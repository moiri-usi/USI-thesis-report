\section{Introduction} % Major section

This document provides an outline of the planned work for the master thesis
"Accelerator for Event-based Failure Prediction". The document addresses the
problem considered by the thesis, a state of the art outline as well as
important questions and hypothesis that arise or are needed for the thesis.
Further the document provides a list of necessary theory bases and introduces
the design and experimenting methods applied in the thesis. Finally, the
document gives an overview of necessary material in terms of literature and
equipment, shows the preliminary work progress and provides a broad time
schedule.

\section{Problem and Research Area} % Major section

In today's live it becomes increasingly important, that computer systems are
dependable. The reason being, that computer systems are used more and more in
areas where the failure of such a system can lead to catastrophic events.
Banking, public transportation and medical engineering are only a few examples
of areas employing large and extremely complex systems. The increasing
complexity of computer systems has a direct impact on their maintainability and
testability. It is simply impossible to guarantee that a piece of software comes
without any faults. On top of that, the same problematic arises with the
hardware components which also may contain faulty parts but also gets
increasingly prone to failures due to decay of material.

In the event of a system failure it is of course desirable to fix the system as
soon as possible in order to minimize the downtime of the system (maximize the
availability). This can be accomplished by using different types of recovery
techniques, e.g. Check-pointing (create checkpoints to roll back/forward),
system replication (switch to a redundant system), fail over (reboot). All these
techniques require a certain amount of time to complete the recovery process,
time that is very expensive. In order to minimize this time, techniques have
been developed to anticipate upcoming failures. Such a technique is described in
\cite{salfner08}.

The work presents a new algorithm to predict failures and compares the results
with other techniques. The accuracy of the presented algorithm to predict
failures proves to be better compared to the other techniques, has however the
drawback of increased complexity and hence increased computation time. It is
very important to keep the computation overhead very low in order to maximize
the time between the prediction of a failure and the actual event of the
failure. One way to decrease the computation time is to design a hardware
accelerator for the prediction algorithm. The design of such an accelerator is
outlined in this document.

The presented algorithm uses system information, e.g. log entries, to predict
failures during runtime (online). To be able to interpret the log files, it is
important that they are structured in a standardized format. Further it is
necessary input real log files to the algorithm in order to verify its
performance (in terms of precision and speed). Unfortunately it is not possible
to use the same data already used in the reference work, because of
confidentiality issues. For this reason, new test data have to be generated by
respecting the data properties described in the reference work as well as
respecting a log representation standard.

\section{State of the Art Outline} % Major section

This section provides a brief outline of the state of the art in the different
fields of research that are relevant for the thesis. This includes a small
overview of failure prediction methods, existing solutions to accelerate
failure prediction algorithms and concepts of log standardization.

%------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Failure Prediction} % Sub-section

A very detailed overview of failure prediction methods is given in
\cite{ACM10_Salfner}. The techniques used as comparison in the main reference
\cite{salfner08} as well as the described technique are listed below.

\begin{itemize} % Numbered list example
    \item Event-based Failure Prediction \cite{salfner08} 
    \item Dispersion Frame Technique (DFT) \cite{lin88}
    \item Eventset \cite{ICDM02_Vilalta}
    \item SVD-SVM \cite{domeniconi02}
\end{itemize}

Maybe some words about the counter ideas (SEER: a lightweight online failure
prediction approach)

%------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Accelerator} % Sub-section

The following list presents designs to accelerate algorithms related to machine
learning and the computation of hidden Markov models:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \cite{ASAP12_Azhar} presents an architecture for a lightweight Viterbi
        accelerator designed for a embedded processor datapath.
    \item \cite{FCCM09_Cadambi} describes a FPGA based accelerator for the
        SVM-SMO (support vector machine - sequential minimal optimization)
        algorithm used in the domain of machine learning.
    \item \cite{IPDPS07_Jacob,ICS06_Maddimsetty,IPDPS07_Oliver} describes a FPGA
        based accelerator for protein sequence HHM search. The Viterbi algorithm
        is used.
    \item \cite{IPDPS09_Walters} describes i.a. an approach to accelerate the
        Viterbi algorithm from the HMMER library using GPUs.
\end{itemize}

%------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Log Standardization} % Sub-section

\cite{IPDPS04_Salfner} describes an approach on how to standardize logs. Still
missing are sources for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item data generation in order to verify an algorithm
    \item metrics to measure log quality
    \item more on log standardization
\end{itemize}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Questions and Hypothesis} % Major section

The following list is intended to give an overview of open questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item how to parallelize the algorithm
    \item what kind of accelerator (SVM, GPU, just use multiple cores)
    \item how to generate test data to verify the accelerator
    \item \dots
\end{itemize}

The accelerator will be designed by taking the following hypotheses into account:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Algorithm of Felix is accurate but slow (to verify by online tests)
    \item the system using the accelerator provides standardized log events
    \item only the online part of the algorithm needs to be accelerated
    \item \dots
\end{itemize}
