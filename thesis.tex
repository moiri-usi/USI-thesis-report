\begin{abstract}
    A large part of the society depends on technology. It is important
    that such technology is dependable. In order to make systems dependable,
    various techniques are available. One such technique is failure prediction.
    While failure prediction alone will not increase the dependability, it
    provides valuable information to facilitate the increase of availability
    and reliability of systems. The anticipation of upcoming failures allows to
    perform countermeasures in order to prevent systems from reaching a failure
    state.

    This thesis proposes an accelerator design on a \acrfull{fpga} for
    a failure prediction algorithm. The algorithm is based on the processing of
    error event sequences, modeled with a \acrfull{hsmm}. The sequence
    processing is based on the forward algorithm. The design and implementation
    of the forward algorithm is provided in a fixed point data representation
    and proposes a simple operand scaling method with a low overhead. The
    design focuses on low resource utilisation and energy consumption. The
    accelerator outperforms conventional processors by a factor of up to 48.85.

\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:intro}
\glsresetall % reset acronyms

Nowadays it is increasingly important that computer systems are dependable.
Computer systems are used more and more in areas where failure can lead to
catastrophic events.  Banking, public transportation and medical engineering
are only a few examples of areas where large and complex systems are employed.
The increasing complexity of computer systems has a direct impact on their
maintainability and testability. It is simply impossible to guarantee that
a piece of \gls{sw} comes without any faults. On top of that, the same problem
arises with the \gls{hw} components which may contain faulty parts and get
increasingly prone to failures due to decay of material.

In the event of a system failure it is desirable to fix the system as soon as
possible, in order to minimize the downtime of the system (maximize the
availability). This can be accomplished by using different types of recovery
techniques, e.g. checkpointing (create checkpoints to roll back/forward),
failover (switch to a redundant system), reboot. All these techniques require
a certain amount of time to complete the recovery process. This time is very
valuable, as during the recovery the system is down and cannot provide the
required service. In order to minimize this time, techniques have been
developed to anticipate upcoming failures. The survey \cite{ACM10_Salfner}
categorizes and describes several proposed failure prediction techniques. One
specific technique will be the reference work for this thesis and is described
in \cite{salfner08}.

The accuracy of the proposed algorithm to predict failures in
\cite{salfner08} proves to be better compared to the other techniques
\cite{lin88, ICDM02_Vilalta, domeniconi02}. However, it has the drawback of
increased complexity and hence increased computation time. It is very important
to keep the computation overhead low in order to maximize the time between the
prediction of a failure and the actual event of the failure. One way to
decrease the computation time is to design a \gls{hw} accelerator for the
prediction algorithm. The design of such an accelerator is outlined in this
thesis.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%===============================================================================
\section{Problem Statement}
\label{ch:_intro_prob}

The main idea of the prediction model proposed in the reference work
\cite{salfner08}, is to predict failures based on sequences of events with
their time of occurrence. This is modeled with a \gls{hsmm}. The fundamental
concept is described in Chapter \ref{ch:event}. A detailed description can be
found in Chapter \cite{salfner08}. In order to perform a prediction, three
parts are required: the training of the model, the sequence processing and the
classification. The training of the model uses collected error event data
samples and corresponding oracle predictions (collected from known failures) to
train the parameters of the model. The training of the model is not time
critical and is performed off-line (not on a live system). The trained model is
then able to detect similar sequences as the ones that led to failures in
previous cases. This is the second part, the sequence processing. This part is
time critical as it happens on-line on a live system. The system will
continuously send error events to the sequence processing unit which needs to
compute a likelihood of the sequence of the last $L$ events. This likelihood
describes the probability of the observed sequence to be similar to one that
led to a failure in previous cases. It is sent to a classifier where it is
compared to a non-failure sequence likelihood. The classifier then predicts if
the sequence at hand will lead to a failure in the near future.

The failure prediction method, as it was outlined in very few words above and
discussed in \cite{salfner08}, leads to very good prediction results (cf.
Chapter \ref{ch:event} for more information). This comes at the price of high
computational efforts that are necessary to perform the sequence processing.
This may lead to situations where a failure is correctly predicted, but the
result of the prediction is only available after the failure has already
occurred. This would rend the prediction useless. The main goal of this thesis,
is to accelerate the sequence processing part in order to predict a failure
before it happens. The acceleration will be achieved by running the prediction
algorithm on specialized \gls{hw}. A common acceleration method, is to split
the algorithm in multiple parts and run each part in parallel on separate
computational units. To do so, first available parallelism and an appropriate
accelerator architecture must be found. Then the accelerator must be designed
and implemented, based on the analysis. Finally the acceleration design must
be compared to a serial implementation and the speedup and accuracy must be
computed.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%===============================================================================
\section{Motivation}
\label{ch:intro_mot}

As outlined before, it becomes increasingly important to provide dependable
infrastructure for information systems. Failure prediction is a very hot
research topic with a main focus on server infrastructure. The proposed
prediction algorithm targets single server nodes. With the recent trend of
moving everything to the cloud, one may question the usefulness of failure
prediction of single nodes. Rather than focusing on single machines it may
prove beneficial to only consider the interaction of nodes and predict failures
on a bigger scale. Why then designing an accelerator for a prediction model
that targets single server systems?

Despite the trend of moving to the cloud, there are still thousands of single
node systems that have a huge impact on a vast amount of people where failures
would prove to be catastrophic. The talk is about embedded systems. Embedded
systems are everywhere and the number is increasing. While server farms are
growing, there is also the trend of specializing information systems. With the
advances of computer \gls{hw}, performance is available with less space and
energy requirements and hence machines (e.g. industrial devices,
transportation, surveillance) are getting more intelligent with the increasing
trend to embed powerful systems. Transportation (trains, planes, cars) is
a prime example of dependable embedded systems. Huge efforts have been made to
make fully autonomous transportation systems failure prone (e.g. bullet train
in Japan) by adding redundant resources. Accurate failure prediction systems
may be a key to reduce these resources or to increase the dependability.

Another issue with the proposed failure prediction method is the high amount of
parameters that need to be identified, estimated and set. Even if this initial
work is done, the process must be repeated after some time interval, due to the
fact that properties of server system change during their lifetime. This is
usually not the case for embedded systems. Once an embedded system is designed
and installed, \gls{sw} changes are a lot less common (neglecting the consumer
market which is not the main target here), hence the system parameters do not
change often or not at all. It is therefore sufficient to do the parameter
configuration only once during design time. Another aspect is the specific
application domain of embedded systems. They are designed for very specific
functions and offer a better insight in process properties than this is the
case with complex \gls{sw} architectures on server systems. A parametrization
of the failure prediction system for an embedded system will in general prove
to be easier than for server systems.

These are the reasons why this work presents an acceleration for the failure
prediction method proposed by \cite{salfner08}. The accelerator will be designed
with special attention on low resource and energy requirements, as the main
targets are single node embedded systems for industrial applications.

\section{Structure}
\label{ch:intro_struct}

This section gives an overview of the structure of the thesis. Chapter
\ref{ch:art} presents existing work, done in the area of failure prediction and
acceleration of related algorithms. Chapter \ref{ch:event} provides a short
overview of the prediction model to be accelerated and presents the results
obtained by using the prediction model in a real case scenario. This is
discussed in detail in the reference work \cite{salfner08}. Chapter
\ref{ch:analysis} focuses on the sequence prediction algorithm and provides an
analysis of available parallelism. In Chapter \ref{ch:design} the design of an
accelerator is proposed and in Chapter \ref{ch:results} results in terms of
speedup and accuracy are presented. Chapter \ref{ch:conc} concludes the work
by presenting the contributions and outlining possible future work related to
the thesis.

\chapter{State of the Art}
\label{ch:art}
\glsresetall % reset acronyms

This section provides an overview of the state of the art in the different
fields of research that are relevant for the thesis. This includes failure
prediction methods, existing solutions to accelerate failure prediction
algorithms and acceleration techniques in general.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%===============================================================================
\section{Failure Prediction}
\label{ch:art_pred}
A detailed overview of failure prediction methods is given in
\cite{ACM10_Salfner}. The survey discusses i.a. the techniques used as
comparison in the main reference
\cite{lin88,IEEE90_lin,ICDM02_Vilalta,domeniconi02} as well as the technique
described in the main reference \cite{salfner08} itself. \cite{lin88} describes
a error-frequency based approach, \cite{ICDM02_Vilalta} uses a data mining
approach and \cite{domeniconi02} is based on classification. \cite{salfner08}
proposes a technique based on error-event sequence processing and delivers
the best results with the cost of higher computation time (cf. Chapter
\ref{ch:event} for more details).

More recent work uses \gls{hw} counters of a general purpose \gls{cpu} and
combines them with \gls{sw} instrumentation to analyze failures of single
processes (e.g grep, flex, sed) \cite{FSE10_Yilmaz}. As industry heads more and
more towards cloud computing, it has been proposed to use information of
interaction between nodes (instead of analyzing single nodes) in order to
analyze and predict failures of a distributed system
\cite{IEEE12_Salfner,DSN10_Oliner}.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%===============================================================================
\section{Accelerator}
\label{ch:art_acc}

The main goal of this master thesis is to accelerate an extension of the
forward algorithm. The forward algorithm is used in the context of \glspl{hmm}.
It is used to compute the probability of occurrence of a certain sequence,
given a \gls{hmm}. A proposals for \gls{gpu} based accelerator for the classic
forward algorithm is described in \cite{liu09}. Further, several proposals to
accelerate the Viterbi algorithm (which is closely related to the forward
algorithm) have been published: \cite{ASAP12_Azhar} presents an architecture
for a lightweight Viterbi accelerator designed for an embedded processor
datapath, \cite{IPDPS07_Jacob,ICS06_Maddimsetty,IPDPS07_Oliver} describe
a \gls{fpga} based accelerator for protein sequence \gls{hmm} search and
\cite{IPDPS09_Walters} describes i.a. an approach to accelerate the Viterbi
algorithm from the HMMER library\footnote{http://hmmer.janelia.org/} using
\glspl{gpu}.

Focusing on a more general approach for acceleration, \cite{ARITH13_Kadric}
proposes an \gls{fpga} implementation of a parallel floating point accumulation
and \cite{ITNG07_Yang} describes the implementation of a vector processor on
\gls{fpga}.

Quite some research has been done on the question of what type of technology
should be used to accelerate computation intensive algorithms:
\cite{SASP08_Che} presents a performance study of different applications
accelerated on a multicore \gls{cpu}, on a \gls{gpu} and on a \gls{fpga},
\cite{FPL10_Jones} discusses the suitability of \gls{fpga} and \gls{gpu}
acceleration for \gls{hpcs} without focusing on a specific application and
\cite{ISVLSI10_Kestur} also focuses on \gls{hpcs} but uses the \gls{blas} as
comparison and also takes \glspl{cpu} into account.

It may be interesting to also think about an acceleration of the model
training. While \cite{salfner08} proposes to perform the training off-line with
no time constraints, it may be beneficial constantly train the model parameters
on-line, due to possible changes of the system. Similar work has been done by
accelerating \glspl{svm}: \cite{FCCM09_Cadambi} describes a \gls{fpga} based
accelerator for the \gls{svm}-\gls{smo} algorithm used in the domain of machine
learning and \cite{IEEE03_Anguita} proposes a new algorithm and its
implementation on a \gls{fpga} for \glspl{svm}.

\chapter{Event-based Failure Prediction}
\label{ch:event}
\glsresetall % reset acronyms

This section provides a brief overview of the computational steps done by the
proposed algorithm described in the reference work \cite{salfner08}.

To be able to understand the formal expression of the algorithm, first
a definition of the fixed parameters is provided.
\begin{itemize}
    \item N: number of states of the \gls{hsmm}
    \item M: number of observation symbols (size of the alphabet)
    \item L: observation sequence length
    \item R: number of \glspl{cdf} (kernels)
\end{itemize}
These are fixed parameters because they need to be set at design time,
based on the properties of the system emitting error events.

The proposed failure prediction method aims to find sequences of error events
that led to failures in the system on previous occasions. In addition to
a specific sequence of events, also the time of occurrence of the event is taken
into account (or more precisely, the delay as defined in Equation
\ref{eq:delay}). The error events that are produced by the system usually need
to be preprocessed or brought in to a form understandable for the predictor.
The error events must build a set of distinct symbols, denoted as $A=\{o_1,
\dots, o_M\}$. This set is also called alphabet of size $M$. Details on
preprocessing the events can be found in Section \ref{ch:event_data}. The
delay of the event at time $ t_k $ with respect to the event at time $ t_{k-1}
$ is described as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:delay}
    d_k = t_k-t_{k-1}
\end{equation}

To detect specific sequences of events by also taking the time of occurrence
into account, an extension of the \gls{hmm} is proposed. The resulting model is
called \acrfull{hsmm}. A extended forward algorithm is used to compute the
likelihood of occurrence of a certain sequence of observation symbols, also
considering the time of occurrence of an observation symbol. Section
\ref{ch:event_sequ} presents the formal definitions of the algorithm on how the
sequences are processed. The computed likelihood of a model is then used in
a classifier to decide if a failure is predicted. The decision to predict
a failure is based on multiple models where one model computes the likelihood
of non-failure sequences. Section \ref{ch:event_class} describes the
classification.

In order to predict failure types with sequence processing, the \gls{hsmm} has
to be trained. The training is performed with an adaptation of the Baum-Welch
algorithm. Section \ref{ch:event_train} provides a very brief description and
lists the trained features necessary for the sequence processing.

The system supports multiple failure types where for each type a separate
model must be built. Additionally a non-failure model is built in order to
classify sequences. Figure \ref{fig:model} provides a schematic overview of
a complete prediction model with multiple failure types.

\begin{figure}

    \input{./schema/model.tex}
    \caption{Overview of the failure prediction approach. Model 0 is trained
        with non-failure sequences.}
    \label{fig:model}
\end{figure}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%===============================================================================
\section{Data Processing}
\label{ch:event_data}

The failure prediction method is based on error events. The most common form of
how error events are saved is log entries in a file structure. Although work
has been done to propose standardized techniques on how log events should be
stored (\cite{IPDPS04_Salfner, DSN09_Ziming}), it is still not common to
follow such approaches. This results in a large number of different log
structures that makes automated processing of such data difficult. Common
issues that need to be taken care of are: different representation of time
stamps, numbers in log messages that need to be filtered (e.g. process id),
typos and different text messages with the same meaning.

The reference work \cite{salfner08} describes methods on how to process log
files and create unique error ids that then build an alphabet of symbols. This
has been done on real case data. In this work no \gls{hw} or \gls{sw} solution
is provided to pre-process data. It is assumed that the events are already in
a form that is readable by the accelerator.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%===============================================================================
\section{Training of the Model}
\label{ch:event_train}

The model training is based on an extension of the Baum-Welch Algorithm. The
model needs to be trained only once. Afterwards it can be used without
training.  Therefore, this part will not be accelerated. Hence, only a brief,
non-formal description of the algorithm is presented. For a more detailed
explanation and proof, refer to \cite{salfner08}. The training is used to
estimate the parameters for each \gls{hsmm}.

The parameters to be trained are used by the extended forward algorithm, an
algorithm that allows to compute a sequence likelihood, for each sequence of
observation symbols (error events). The forward algorithm is described in
the next section. Following the parameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $ \pi_i $, forming the initial state probability vector
        $ \boldsymbol{\pi} $ of size $ N $
    \item $ b_i(o_j) $, forming the emission probability matrix $ B $ of size
        $ N \times M $
    \item $ p_{ij} $, forming the matrix of limiting transmission probabilities
        $ P $ of size $ N \times N $
    \item $ \omega_{ij, r} $, the weights of the kernel $ r $, with
        $i,j \in \{1, \dots, N\} $
    \item $ \theta_{ij, r} $, the parameters of the kernel $ r $, with
        $i,j \in \{1, \dots, N\} $
\end{itemize}

The estimation of the parameters can be done by using real error event logs,
associated to real failures. The delay and id of each error event as well as
the timestamp and type of the failure are known. With an iterative approach
(Baum-Welch algorithm), the parameters can be estimated in order to allow the
\gls{hsmm} to produce a value that describes the likelihood of a specific event
sequence to produce a failure of a specific type. Due to the proposed extension
of also taking the delay of an event into account, the Baum-Welch algorithm was
extended with a gradient descent approach to estimate the kernel parameters of
the chosen \glspl{cdf}.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%===============================================================================
\section{Sequence Processing}
\label{ch:event_sequ}

The following description will provide a complete blueprint of the extended
forward algorithm, without any explanations or proofs related to the
formulation. Those are provided in \cite{salfner08}. While the basic forward
algorithm is used to calculate a sequence likelihood based on an \gls{hmm}, with
the extension it is possible to do the same for the proposed \gls{hsmm}. The
extension takes into account that events are not emitted with a constant
period.  This variance of the delay (cf. \ref{eq:delay}) is modeled by
introducing one or more \glspl{cdf}, also called kernels. The extended forward
algorithm is formally defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:forward_init}
    \alpha_0(i) = \pi_{i}b_{s_i}(O_0) \\
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:forward}
    \alpha_k(j) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \alpha_{k-1}(i) v_{ij}(d_k) b_{s_j}(O_k);
    \quad 1 \leq k \leq L
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_k(i)$ is a component of the forward variable vector.
$v_{ij}(d_k)$ is called the transition probability, forming the matrix $V$ of
size $N \times N$, defined as:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:V}
    v_{ij}(d_k) = \left\{
        \begin{array}{l l}
            p_{ij} d_{ij}(d_k)
                & \quad \text{if $j \neq i$}\\
            1 - \sum\limits_{\substack{h=1 \\ h \neq i}}^{N} p_{ih} d_{ih}(d_k)
                & \quad \text{if $j = i$}
        \end{array} \right.
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:D}
    d_{ij}(d_k) = \sum_{r=1}^{R} \omega_{ij,r}\kappa_{ij,r}(d_k|\theta_{ij, r})
\end{equation}
$d_{ij}(d_k)$ is forming the matrix of cumulative transition duration
distribution functions $D(d_k)$ of size $ N\times N$. While the kernel
parameters are fixed (with the training of the model), the delay of the event
is not. This implies that for each event, a new transition probability matrix
must be computed.

For simplification reasons, only one kernel is used. Due to this, the kernel
weights can be ignored. Equation \ref{eq:D} can then be simplified to:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:D_fact}
    d_{ij}(d_k) = \kappa_{ij}(d_k | \theta_{ij})
\end{equation}

The kernel parameters are dependent of the choice of \glspl{cdf} (a choice that
is done at design time). E.g. the Gaussian \gls{cdf} results in the kernel
parameters $\mu_{ij}$ and $\sigma_{ij}$.

Comparing the extended forward algorithm to the basic version, the only
difference is the transition probability matrix. While the extension has
variable transition probabilities, those of the basic version are constant. The
basic Equation can be expressed as

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:forward_init_basic}
    \alpha_0(i) = \pi_{i}b_{s_i}(O_0) \\
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:forward_basic}
    \alpha_k(j) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \alpha_{k-1}(i) a_{ij} b_{s_j}(O_k);
    \quad 1 \leq k \leq L
\end{equation}

Throughout the document, one transition probability of the basic forward
algorithm will always be denoted as $a_{ij}$ and the matrix as $A$, while for
the extension the notation $v_{ij}$ for the probability and $V$ for the matrix
will be used. If both versions are addressed at the same time, the notation
$q_{ij}$ for one element will be used and $Q$ for the matrix.

The last set of forward variables $ \alpha_L $ are then summed up to compute
a probabilistic measure for the similarity of the observed sequence compared to
the sequences in the training data set. This is called the sequence likelihood:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:P}
    P_s(\boldsymbol{o}|\lambda) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N} \alpha_L(i)
\end{equation}
where $ \lambda = \{\boldsymbol{\pi}, P, B, D(d_k) \} $.

To prevent $ \alpha $ from going to zero very fast, at each step of the forward
algorithm a scaling is performed:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:scaled}
    \alpha_k(i) = c_k \alpha_k(i)
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:scaling_factor}
    c_k = \frac{1}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N} \alpha_k(i)}
\end{equation}

By applying scaling, instead of the sequence likelihood (Equation \ref{eq:P}),
the sequence log-likelihood must be computed:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:Plog}
    \log(P_s(\boldsymbol{o}|\lambda)) = -\sum\limits_{k=1}^{L} \log c_k
\end{equation}
where $ \lambda = \{\boldsymbol{\pi}, P, B, D(d_k) \} $, defining the set of
parameters.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%===============================================================================
\section{Classification}
\label{ch:event_class}

The classification step is based on Bayes decision theory and a classification
by threshold. Due to multiple reasons explained in \cite{salfner08}, it is not
possible to perform a multi-class classification in case of the log-likelihood
(which is used if scaling is applied). Therefore the classification problem is
reduced to a dual-class problem by selecting the maximum log sequence
likelihood of the failure models and comparing it to the log sequence
likelihood of the non-failure model:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:class}
    \text{class}(s) = F \iff \max_{i=1}^{u} \big [
        \log P(\boldsymbol{s}|\lambda_i)
    \big ] - \log P(\boldsymbol{s}|\lambda_0) > \log \theta_{th}
\end{equation}
with $\boldsymbol{s}$ denoting the sequence, $\lambda_i$ representing the
parameter set of the failure models, $\lambda_0$ the parameter set of the
non-failure model and
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:class_thresh}
    \theta_{th} = \frac{(r_{\bar{F}F} - r_{\bar{F}\bar{F}})P(c_{\bar{F}})}
        {(r_{F \bar{F}} - r_{FF})P(c_{F})}
\end{equation}
To calculate $\theta_{th}$, the following parameters need to be set:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $ P(c_{\bar{F}}) $: prior of non-failure class
    \item $ P(c_F) $: prior of failure class
    \item $ r_{\bar{F}\bar{F}} $: true negative prediction
    \item $ r_{FF} $: true positive prediction
    \item $ r_{\bar{F}F} $: false positive prediction
    \item $ r_{F\bar{F}} $: false negative prediction
\end{itemize}
If $\text{class}(s) = F$, it is predicted that a failure will occur.

If no scaling is used, the dual-class classification problem can be formulated
as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:class_ns}
    \frac{P(s|\lambda_F)}{P(s|\lambda_{\bar{F}})} > \theta_{th}
\end{equation}
with $\boldsymbol{s}$ denoting the sequence, $\lambda_F$ representing the
parameter set of the failure model and $\lambda_{\bar{F}}$ the parameter set of
the non-failure model. $\theta_{th}$ is defined with Equation \ref{eq:class_thresh}.

For multi-class classification the following rule can be used:
\begin{equation}
    \sum_t r_{tF_a} P(\boldsymbol{s}|c_t) P(c_t)
    > \sum_t r_{t\bar{F}} P(\boldsymbol{s}|c_t) P(c_t)
\end{equation}
Each element $r_{tF_a}$ of the risk matrix defines the cost / risk of
associating a pattern $\boldsymbol{s}$ with the class $c_{F_a}$ where it really
belongs to class $c_t$. $c_t$ denotes a failure or the non-failure class,
$c_{F_a}$ a failure class and $c_{\bar{F}}$ the non-failure class.

\section{Metrics}
\label{ch:event_metrics}

The failure prediction algorithm as briefly described in this chapter has been
verified on real case data. The results in Figure \ref{fig:results_salfner} are
cited from \cite{salfner08} and show the precision, recall, F-measure and false
positive rate metrics of the following failure prediction algorithms:
\begin{description}
    \item[periodic] This is a failure prediction method that is used to estimate
        a lower bound and is derived directly from reliability theory.
    \item[\acrshort{dft}] The \acrfull{dft} is described in \cite{lin88}. It is
        based on the notion that errors occur more frequently before failures
        occur. It is an error-frequency based approach.
    \item[Eventset] The idea of this method is to find a good set of error
        events in order to capture as many failures as possible. Training is
        used. The method is described in \cite{ICDM02_Vilalta}. It is
        a data-mining approach.
    \item[\acrshort{svd}-\acrshort{svm}] \acrfull{svd} is used to reduce the
        number of dimensions in bag of words error sequence representation.
        This method follows a classification approach. \glspl{svm} are used
        as classification technique. It is described in \cite{domeniconi02}.
    \item[HSMM] This is the proposed algorithm of the reference work
        \cite{salfner08} where it is described in detail. It is the method for
        which an accelerator is designed in this thesis.
\end{description}
Precision $p$, recall $r$, F-measure $F_\alpha$ and false positive rate $fpr$
are defined as
\begin{equation}
    \text{Precision} \;\;\; p
        \coloneqq \frac{\text{true positives}}{\text{true positives}
        +\text{false positives}}
        = \frac{\text{correct warnings}}{\text{all warnings}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \text{Recall} \;\;\; r 
        \coloneqq \frac{\text{true positives}}{\text{true positives}
        +\text{false negatives}}
        = \frac{\text{correct warnings}}{\text{failures}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \text{F-measure} \;\;\; F_{\alpha}
        \coloneqq \frac{p \cdot r}{(1-\alpha)p + \alpha r}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is used to weight the precision.
\begin{equation}
    \text{false positive rate} \;\;\; fpr
    \coloneqq \frac{\text{false positives}}
        {\text{false positives}+\text{true negatives}}

\chapter{Theoretical Analysis of the Forward Algorithm}
\label{ch:analysis}
\glsresetall % reset acronyms

This chapter provides details about the forward algorithm and available (and
useful) parallelization techniques applicable to the algorithm. The generally
known forward algorithm as well as the extended version proposed in
\cite{salfner08} are discussed. Further, scaling techniques of the forward
variables and their impact on data representation choices are presented.
Finally the observations are presented in an overview and an appropriate choice
on possible acceleration \gls{hw} is made.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%===============================================================================
\section{Serial Implementation and Complexity}
\label{ch:analysis_serial}

The sequential implementation of the basic forward algorithm is represented in
Figure \ref{list:forward_basic}. It consist of three steps: the initialization
step, the computation of consecutive forward variables and the final step,
where the likelihood is computed. The initial $ \alpha $ variable is computed
by multiplying the initial state probability with the emission probability of
the first observation symbol of the sequence (cf. Equation
\ref{eq:forward_init}). The computation of the following forward variables
consists of three nested loops: the outer loop iterates over the $ L $ sets of
$ N $ $ \alpha $ variables where each variable $\alpha_k(i)$ depends on all
prior computed variables $\alpha_{k-1}$ and the k-th observation symbol of
a sequence. The first inner loop iterates over the $ N $ $ \alpha $ variables
of one set where each variable is computed with the innermost loop. The two
nested inner loops form the Matrix-Vector-Vector multiplication
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:mvv}
    \alpha_{k+1}(i) = \big(Q \alpha_k\big)(i) \cdot \big(B(O_k)\big)(i) \;\;\;
        \forall i \in \{1, \dots, N\}
\end{equation}
where $ \alpha_k $ is a vector of size $ N $ of the prior computed $ \alpha
$ variables, $ Q $ a matrix of size $ N \times N $ containing the transition
probabilities and $ B(O_k) $ a vector of size $ N $ containing the emission
probabilities of the k-th observation symbol. Note that the first
multiplication is a Matrix-Vector multiplication that results in a vector
which is then multiplied element-wise with the vector $ B(O_k) $. The Equation
\ref{eq:forward} describes the formal definition of the forward algorithm. In
the final step the likelihood is computed, by summing up all elements of the
last forward variable $ \alpha_L $ (cf. Equation \ref{eq:P}).

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \lstinputlisting[language=Octave]
        {../accelerator/model/forward_s_basic.m}
    \caption{Pseudo-code of the forward algorithm.}
    \label{list:forward_basic}
\end{figure}

As proposed by the reference work, the forward variables can be scaled, in
order to prevent the result from getting very small due to the continuous
multiplication of probabilities. The implementation of the proposed scaling
method is shown in Figure \ref{list:forward_scaling}. The scaling is formally
defined by the Equations \ref{eq:scaled} and \ref{eq:scaling_factor}. Due to the
scaling, instead of the likelihood, the log-likelihood is computed. Equation
\ref{eq:Plog} gives the formal definition.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \lstinputlisting[language=Octave]
        {../accelerator/model/forward_s_scaling.m}
    \caption{Pseudo-code of the forward algorithm with scaling.}
    \label{list:forward_scaling}
\end{figure}

The algorithm to compute the sequence likelihood proposed by \cite{salfner08}
is an extension of the forward algorithm presented in the Figures
\ref{list:forward_basic} and \ref{list:forward_scaling}. Instead of constant
transition probabilities, the extended algorithm computes a new transition
probability matrix (size $ N \times N$) for each arriving observation symbol,
by considering the delay of the new symbol with respect to the prior symbol.
The computation of the transition probability matrix $ Q $ is implemented with
Figure \ref{list:ext} and formally defined by the Equations \ref{eq:V},
\ref{eq:D}, \ref{eq:D_fact} and \ref{eq:kernel}. As in \cite{salfner08}, also
here for reasons of simplification, only one kernel is used. In the sample code
the Gaussian cumulative distribution function is used. The function needs to be
called for every k.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \lstinputlisting[language=Octave]
        {../accelerator/model/compute_tp.m}
        \caption{Extension of the forward algorithm with only one (Gaussian)
            kernel.}
    \label{list:ext}
\end{figure}

The order of time complexity of the basic as well as th extended algorithm is
$O(LN^2)$. The introduction of scaling and/or the extension increases the
number of necessary operations by a constant factor. The order of complexity
stays therefore the same. This is also true for the space complexity which is of
order $O(N^2)$. The order of complexity is important for big $N$ and $L$.
However for smaller values of $N$ and $L$, the real complexity becomes more
important. Sections \ref{ch:analysis_scale} and \ref{ch:analysis_ext} will
discuss scaling respectively the extension in detail.

%===============================================================================
\section{Parallelism and Feasible Parallelization}
\label{ch:analysis_parallel}

Parallelization methods are applied in order to increase the throughput or
reduce the latency of a task, or to achieve both at the same time. It can be
done at the cost of increased usage of parallel computation units, memory and
memory bandwidth.

Considering only the basic forward algorithm (Figure
\ref{list:forward_basic}), the computation of the likelihood is divided into
$L+1$ steps: the initialization, $L-1$ identical intermediate steps and the
finalization. Because of the recursive nature of the algorithm, all steps
(except the initialization) depend on the previously computed forward
variables. For this reason a direct parallelization of the steps is not
possible. However, with each arrival of a new observation symbol, the last $L$
elements of the observation symbol sequence are used to compute the likelihood
(cf. Figure \ref{fig:sliding}). This can be exploited to pipeline the steps in
order to increase the throughput. By building a pipeline of $L+1$ stages where
each step of the forward algorithm corresponds to a pipeline stage,
a likelihood is computed at every completion of a step, with a latency of
$(L+1)*t_{step_{max}}$ where $t_{step_{max}}$ is the time needed to complete
the computation of the most complex step (each stage of the pipeline must take
the same amount of clock cycles). The throughput of a pipelined compared to
a non-pipelined system is increased by factor $L$ (assuming an infinite runtime
or by ignoring the setup time). Another and more important fact that makes the
pipeline architecture very beneficial in this particular case: the
configuration allows to load the transition probabilities $Q$ and the emission
probabilities $b_i(o_k)$ for all steps at the same time. This reduces the load
operations by factor $L$. This is visualized in the Table \ref{tab:pipeline}.
The table shows the pipeline stages with input values that are fed to the stage
before the execution and the output values resulting after the execution of
the pipeline stage. Figure \ref{fig:pipeline} shows a schematic representation
of the pipeline. Note that the input values $Q$ and $B$ always depend on
the same observation symbol. The parameter $d_k$ of the transition
probabilities can be ignored in this case because only in the extended forward
algorithm they depend on $d_k$. This will be discussed further when the
extension is considered.

    \caption{Schematic representation of the pipelined forward algorithm.}
    \label{fig:pipeline}
\end{figure}

By considering all dissimilar steps of the forward algorithm, more
parallelization options can be found. In the initial step, $N$ components of
the first forward variable $\alpha_1$ are computed by multiplying independent
pairs of an initial state probability $\pi_i$ and an emission probability of
the first observation symbol $b_i(o_0)$. This can be fully parallelized by
replicating the multiplication operation $N$ times. Doing this results in an
increase of the throughput by factor $N$ and a decrease of the latency by
factor $\frac{1}{N}$, assuming that $N$ multipliers are available and the
memory bandwidth is able to provide a data throughput $N$ times higher than in
the sequential case.

The computation of the subsequent forward variables $\alpha_k$, with $k
= 2 \dots L$ are equivalent in terms of \gls{hw}. To compute the $N$ elements
of one step, the Matrix-Vector-Vector multiplication described by Equation
\ref{eq:mvv} must be performed. Considering first only the Matrix-Vector
multiplication, this can be parallelized by decomposing the matrix into
subsets and then use multiple computational units to perform multiplication
and/or accumulation operations in parallel on the subsets. An intuitive
decomposition can be done either by block-striped matrix partitioning
(decomposition into subsets of rows or columns) or by checkerboard block matrix
partitioning (decomposition in rectangular sets of elements). These
partitioning methods are shown in Figure \ref{fig:matrix_partitioning}. The
number of subsets must correspond to the number of available computational
units to perform the necessary operations. The choice of decomposition is
heavily dependant on the accelerator architecture (e.g. communication between
computational units, memory architecture). The resulting vector can then be
multiplied element-wise with the emission probability vector. This is again the
same case as the initial step described above. In case of the block-striped
matrix partitioning, the maximally achievable increase of the throughput is
a factor of $N$ and the latency can be decreased by factor $\frac{1}{N}$,
assuming that $N$ computational units are available to perform the
multiplication and accumulation operation on each subset, $N$ multipliers to
compute the final element-wise vector-vector multiplication and a memory
interface that can handle a data throughput that is $N$ times higher than in
the sequential case. The checkerboard partitioning yields a lower gain but may
be considered in case of fixed computational unit architecture (\gls{cpu},
\gls{gpu}) in order to increase the utilization of resources available in each
unit. Apart from homogeneous partitioning methods as mentioned above also
inhomogeneous solutions have been proposed \cite{IPDPSW12_DeFlumere, clarke11}.
These are not considered in this work, as the focus lies on homogeneous
computation units.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \input{./schema/matrix.tex}
    \caption{Matrix partitioning (from left to right): column-block-striped,
        row-block-striped and checkerboard blocks.}
    \label{fig:matrix_partitioning}
\end{figure}

Further parallelization can be done by using a reduction tree to accumulate the
elements in the matrix-vector multiplication process. Instead of using one
computation unit and accumulating the values sequentially, $N$ units can be used
to first multiply two operands together, then adding $\frac{N}{2}$ resulting
operand pairs in a second step and then consecutively adding resulting pairs
until only one value is left. This process is visualized in Figure
\ref{fig:red_tree}. The maximal increase of throughput is of factor $\log_2(N)$
and the latency can be decreased by factor $\frac{1}{\log_2(N)}$, assuming that
$N$ computation units are available and the memory interface is able to handle
a throughput that is $N$ times higher than in the sequential case.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \input{./schema/red_tree.tex}
    \caption{Example of a reduction tree with $N=5$.}
    \label{fig:red_tree}
\end{figure}

The finalization step of the algorithm consists of calculating the likelihood.
This is done by simply accumulating the $N$ elements of the last forward
variable $\alpha_L$. This operation can be parallelized with a reduction tree,
resulting in a throughput and latency optimization of $log_2(N)$ and
$\frac{1}{log_2(N)}$ respectively as described above.

The following sections will describe the impact on performance if scaling or
the extension of the forward algorithm is implemented. Also the availability of
parallelization in both cases will be discussed. Finally an overview of
available parallelism and a discussion about the usefulness of each
parallelization method in the context of the different algorithm
implementations will be provided.

%===============================================================================
\section{Scaling and Data Representation}
\label{ch:analysis_scaling}

Scaling may be applied to prevent that the continuous multiplication of numbers
smaller than one (e.g. probabilities) result in zero because of the limited
accuracy by digitally representing fractional numbers. Scaling does not
influence the order of complexity of the algorithm. By introducing a scaling
method as proposed in the reference work, the complexity of calculating one
$\alpha_k$ vector goes from $N^2$ (no scaling) to $N^2 + 2N + 1$ (scaling). Both
are of the same order $O(N^2)$. However, the introduction of scaling may
increase the usage of resources significantly: In order to scale $\alpha_k$,
the division operation is used to compute the scaling factor. Division is far
more complex than multiplication and hence uses more resources. Additionally,
instead of the sequence likelihood (Equation \ref{eq:P}) the sequence
log-likelihood (Equation \ref{eq:Plog}) needs to be computed, with the even
more complex log operation.

In order to limit the amount of necessary division operations, it is beneficial
to consider the following: Rather than scaling each element of $\alpha_k$ by
dividing it by a scaling factor ($N$ divisions), first the inverse of the
scaling factor can be computed which is then multiplied with each element of
$\alpha_k$ (one division and $N$ multiplications). Using $N$ multiplication
units, this operation can be parallelized.

To compute the log-likelihood, $N$ log and $N$ sum operations are necessary, in
comparison to $N$ sum operations for the likelihood. In terms of memory, the
log-likelihood is more complex because the scaling coefficients of each
$\alpha_k$ are used and need to be stored, while for the likelihood only the
last set of forward variables $\alpha_L$ are used. The computation of the
log-likelihood can be parallelized by using $N$ units computing the log
function and additionally by a reduction tree to speed up the accumulation.

Instead of using the proposed scaling method, a simpler scaling may be applied.
By analyzing the operands, an average scaling factor can be computed. Using the
knowledge that all the operands are probabilities,

\begin{equation}\begin{split}
    \label{eq:scaling_sum}
    &\hat{\pi} \coloneqq \frac{1}{N}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N} \pi_i = \frac{1}{N} \\
    &\hat{q} \coloneqq \frac{1}{N}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{N} q_{ij} = \frac{1}{N} \\
    &\hat{b} \coloneqq \frac{1}{M}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{M} b_{ij} = \frac{1}{M}
\end{split}\end{equation}

and doing the computation of the forward variables,

\begin{equation}\begin{split}
    \label{eq:scaling_estimation}
    &\hat{\alpha}_1 = \hat{b} \cdot \hat{\pi} = \frac{1}{NM} \\
    &\hat{\alpha}_2 = N \cdot \hat{\alpha}_1 \cdot \hat{q} \cdot \hat{b} =
        N \cdot \frac{1}{NM} \cdot \frac{1}{N} \cdot \frac{1}{M} =
        \frac{1}{NM^2} \\
    &\hat{\alpha}_3 = N \cdot \hat{\alpha}_2 \cdot \hat{q} \cdot \hat{b} =
        N \cdot \frac{1}{NM^2} \cdot \frac{1}{N} \cdot \frac{1}{M} =
        \frac{1}{NM^3} \\
    &\vdots\\
    & \hat{\alpha}_L = \frac{1}{NM^L}
\end{split}\end{equation}

it can be computed that assuming no precision loss at each computational step
$k$, on average a scaling factor of $\frac{1}{M}$ is necessary in each step
$k$. If the intermediate precision of the computational units is high enough to
compensate for scaling too much or too few, this method is an easy solution to
keep the values in an acceptable range. However, if the precision is not
available (eg. if a fixed point data representation is chosen) a fixed scaling
factor can cause an overflow (very bad because the result will be wrong) or an
underflow (may be acceptable because it is only a loss of precision). In this
case, rather than choosing an average scaling factor of $\frac{1}{M}$ it is
safer to choose the scaling factor to be equal to the maximal possible scaling
factor of all values of a specific event in $B$ (scale $\max\big(B(o_j)\big)$).
By doing this, the scaling factor will be too small and if $L$ is big, the
forward variables will still approach zero, only slower than without scaling.
This is either acceptable because of a high precision, or another scaling
factor must be computed to prevent this. The implemented solution will be
explained in detail in Chapter \ref{ch:design}.

Another aspect to consider is the choice of data representation (floating point
versus fixed point). This depends the on one hand on the necessary precision and on
the other hand on the choice of accelerator type. While general purpose
\gls{hw} such as a \gls{cpu}, \gls{gpu} or \gls{dsp} (to some degree) offer an
abstraction to make the representation type transparent to the developer,
specialized \gls{hw} such as a \gls{fpga} or \gls{asic} offer no such
abstraction. For the latter devices, floating point operations increase the
complexity of the \gls{hw} design and the necessary \gls{hw} resources
considerably. In terms of performance, general purpose devices also benefit
from a sparse usage of floating point values. The complexity of the \gls{sw}
development of general purpose devices however is only marginally or not
affected at all by the choice of data representation.

If by choice, scaling is omitted, a fixed point representation will not be
possible due to the rapid convergence towards zero by continuously multiplying
probabilities. This implies that by omitting scaling to save
resources, a floating point representation must be used. This in turn increases
the resource requirements or has a negative impact on performance (or both).

The trade-off between the choice of using scaling or not versus the choice of
the precision and the data representation will be analyzed in more detail in
Chapter \ref{ch:design}, when the technology of the accelerator has been
chosen.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%===============================================================================
\section{Extension of the Forward Algorithm}
\label{ch:analysis_extension}

The proposed extension uses a non constant transition probability matrix. For
every occurring observation symbol, the matrix must be recomputed by using the
delay of the symbol (Equation \ref{eq:delay}) and the sum of different
cumulative distribution functions (Equations \ref{eq:V} and \ref{eq:D}).
Computing $N^2$ cumulative distribution functions is time intensive, but it only
needs to be computed once per $d_k$ and can then be stored for later use.
A transition probability matrix can be used for the computation of $L$ forward
variables due to the continuous computation of likelihood values (as depicted
in Figure \ref{fig:sliding}). This implies that storage for $L$ such matrices
must be available or the matrix must be recomputed when needed and only the
delay value is stored. In case of a pipelined architecture, the additional
storage or computation is not necessary (cf. Figure \ref{fig:pipeline} and
Table \ref{tab:pipeline}). The computation of the transition probability matrix
can be fully parallelized with $R*N^2$ computation units to calculate
a \gls{cdf} of $d_k$ where $R$ is the number of different cumulative
distribution functions necessary to model the behaviour of the events. The
memory interface needs to be able to provide a throughput that is $R*N^2$
higher than in the sequential case (note that each cumulative distribution
function takes several parameters as input. E.g. the normal \gls{cdf} has the
two parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$). In previous chapters, $R$ was always
assumed to be equal to one in order to simplify the problem.

Note that while the computation of one extended transition probability is
independent of $N$ or $L$, it is still more complex than the simple \gls{macc}
operation necessary to calculate a forward variable (cf. the list below). Due
to this, the computational units calculating the transition probability matrix
must provide more performance than the units necessary to compute the
resulting forward variables in order to not limit the throughput. To get
a rough impression of how expensive the computation of a distribution function
is, the following list with three common examples is provided:

\begin{description}
    \item[Exponential \gls{cdf}] \hfill \\
        This distribution function describes the time between
        events in a Poisson process (events occur continuously and independently
        at a constant average rate). It is expressed as
        \begin{equation}
            \label{eq:cdf_exp}
            F_{exp}(x) = \left\{
                \begin{array}{l l}
                    1 - \exp(-\lambda x)
                        & \quad \text{if $x \geq 0$}\\
                    0
                        & \quad \text{if $x < 0$}
                \end{array} \right.
        \end{equation}
        Only the exponential function is needed which is quite a complex
        function compared to a multiplication and could be problematic in a
        fully parallelized implementation (considering all parallelization
        options) but realizable in an implementation with less parallelism.
    \item[Laplace \gls{cdf}] \hfill \\
        This distribution is somewhat the extension of the
        exponential distribution and is also called double exponential
        distribution as it can be described as two exponential distributions
        put together (one flipped horizontally). It is expressed as
        \begin{equation}
            \label{eq:cdf_laplace}
            F_{laplace}(x) = \left\{
                \begin{array}{l l}
                    1 - \frac{1}{2}\exp(-\frac{x-\mu}{b})
                        & \quad \text{if $x \geq \mu$}\\
                    \frac{1}{2} \exp(\frac{x-\mu}{b})
                        & \quad \text{if $x < \mu$}
                \end{array} \right.
        \end{equation}
        In terms of complexity order, the Laplace distribution is equivalent to
        the exponential \gls{cdf}.
    \item[Gaussian \gls{cdf}] \hfill \\
        This is a very important distribution that is used in a lot of
        applications. It is used for real-valued random variables whose
        distributions are not known. The Gaussian (normal) cumulative
        distribution function cannot be expressed in terms of elementary
        functions. The Gaussian kernel is defined as:
        \begin{equation}
            \label{eq:kernel}
            \kappa_{ij, gauss}(d_k | \mu_{ij}, \sigma_{ij}) = 
            \frac{1}{\sigma_{ij}\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp(-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2})
        \end{equation}
        Using the Taylor expansion and the substitution $x
        = \frac{d_k-\mu}{\sigma}$, the \gls{cdf} can be expressed as
        \begin{equation}
            \label{eq:cdf_gauss}
            \Phi(x) = \frac{1}{2}
                + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \cdot \exp(-\frac{x^2}{2})
                \cdot \Bigg[ x+\frac{x^3}{3} + \frac{x^5}{3 \cdot 5} + \cdots
                + \frac{x^{2n+1}}{3 \cdot 5 \cdots (2n+1)} \Bigg]
        \end{equation}
        This computation is very expensive. It comprises of an exponential
        function and an iterative approach (to achieve the necessary precision)
        including the power function and additions. If this distribution is
        chosen to describe the time between events, parallelization will be very
        challenging, in order to prevent this calculation from being the
        bottleneck.
\end{description}

Considering the huge computation power needed to fully parallelize the
extension, it may be beneficial to use a very specialized unit (\gls{asic})
just for the computation of the cumulative distribution function.

Independent of the distribution, in order to not reduce the throughput of the
fully parallelized computation of the forward variables, a small pipeline of
two stages must be built. In the first stage the transition probability matrix
is computed and in the second stage the forward variables.

The correction of the diagonal elements (cf. Figure \ref{list:ext}) can be
maximally parallelized by using $N$ reduction trees to compute the sum of rows
and $N$ subtracters to correct the diagonal elements.

\section{Parallelization Options and Scalability}
\label{ch:analysis_all}

In the sections above, a lot of parallelization options have been proposed.
A maximal parallelization can hardly be achieved due to the immense requirement
of resources and is also not necessary because of dependencies. In a first
step, a theoretical analysis (in terms of complexity order) of the different
parallelization options and their combinations is done. Then the results will
be discussed and a choice will be made. Finally some conclusions about
a reasonable amount of applicable parallelization options will be drawn in
respect to the chosen architecture. Table \ref{tab:summary_O} shows the
pipelined architecture (cf.  Figure \ref{fig:pipeline}), the parallel
architecture in case of maximal row partitioning (cf. Figure
\ref{fig:matrix_partitioning}), the combination of both architectures and in
the last column the combination of both architectures plus the reduction tree
(cf. Figure \ref{fig:red_tree}). The basic and the extended forward algorithm
are both of the same complexity order. As only the complexity order is
considered, different computation times of different operations as well as
scaling operations can be ignored. For simplification reasons, it is assumed that
$N=L$ and that by scaling the problem, $N$ and $L$ are both changing in the
same order.

\begin{table}
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{|l|*{4}{c|}}
            \hline

            \hline
            Throughput
            & $\times N$ & $\times N$ & $\times N^2$ & $\times N^2\log N$ \\
            \hline
            Latency
            & $\times 1$ & $\times \frac{1}{N}$ & $\times \frac{1}{N}$
            & $\times \frac{1}{N\log N}$ \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Comparison of architectures in terms of complexity for the forward
        algorithm.}
    \label{tab:summary_O}
\end{table}

The two first columns show that the smaller latency of the parallel
architecture comes at the price of a larger memory interface (simultaneous
memory access is required). By combining both architectures (3rd column), the
throughput can be increased by factor $N$ at the cost of increasing the order
of computation units. Adding also the reduction tree, throughput and latency
are increased respectively decreased by an additional factor of $\log N$. This
comes again at the cost of increasing the order of computation units further.
While the benefits are welcome, $N^3$ is simply too high to realistically
implement such a solution. Already with a small $N$ a huge server farm or
thousands of \glspl{fpga} or \glspl{gpu} would be necessary. Considering this,
the reduction tree parallelization method will not be used as it gives the
fewest benefits ($O(LogN)$) for its cost ($O(N)$). Computation units in an
order of $N^2$ (2nd column) is feasible for small $N$ by combining multiple
devices. While this may be acceptable for a very important system,  where
lots of people depend upon (e.g. weather forecast, Google queries, etc.)
failure prediction hardly falls into this category especially if failures of an
embedded system are predicted. Additionally, using multiple devices in order
to scale the problem implies off-chip-communication and -memory. This will
result in bottlenecks and have a negative impact on the actual speedup. This
leaves the first two columns to compare for the application at hand (a
combination of both methods can still be considered, but not by using maximal
parallelization).

Table \ref{tab:summary_D} only compares the pipelined architecture with the
parallel architecture but with more detailed estimations of resource usage.
The comparison is done for the basic and the extended forward algorithm (for
explanations refer to the previous sections in this chapter). In case of the
extended forward algorithm, when the parallel architecture is used, there is
a choice to be made whether the parallelization should be achieved by
increasing the memory usage or the number of computational units (hence the two
columns).

    \caption{Pipelined versus parallel architecture for the basic and the

        one \acrshort{cdf}, P: Number of parameters to compute one
        \acrshort{cdf}).}
    \label{tab:summary_D}
\end{table}

The benefits of a parallel architecture over the pipelined are first and
foremost the reduced latency and in case of the basic algorithm also the lower
memory footprint. If the acceleration architecture of choice has a memory
interface that allows the required throughput, for the basic algorithm, this
architecture should be chosen. In case of the extended algorithm this is only
possible if enough computational units are available (and the \gls{cdf} computation
is not too complex) or if the on-chip memory is large enough to save transition
probabilities for later use.

For the basic algorithm, the pipelined architecture should only be chosen if
the memory interface becomes the bottleneck (for large $N$). Ideally,
a combination of the parallel architecture and the pipeline should be chosen in
order to maximize the memory interface usage. By doing this, a smaller latency
is achieved by keeping the throughput high. Another reason to choose the
pipelined architecture would be a simple state transition model (cf. Section
\ref{ch:analysis_simple}). It allows to save only the non-zero transition
probabilities in a list. From this optimisation the pipelined architecture
benefits on a much larger scale as less serial accumulations would be
necessary, while in the parallel architecture only the utilization of the
computational units would be reduced (less power consumption but no impact on
performance).

In case of the extended forward algorithm, it is almost always better to choose
the pipelined architecture: It uses either less memory or less computational
units, allows optimization in case of simple models and allows more time to
compute the transition probabilities. Parallelization is only possible for very
simple \gls{cdf} computations and for a small $N$.

The scalability is in both cases limited but more so with the parallel
architecture: If $N$ or $L$ becomes large such that off-chip memory is
necessary (already for very small $N$ or $L$ for \glspl{cpu} and \glspl{gpu},
less so for more flexible architectures like \glspl{fpga} or \glspl{asic}) the
memory interface will be too small to handle memory access simultaneously and
hence become the bottleneck. The pipelined architecture does not have this
drawback but has a slightly higher memory footprint. If memory can be handled
on-chip but multiple chips are used to increase the number of resources, both
architectures can be scaled easily in $L$ dimension (sequence length) but only
with difficulty in $N$ dimension (number of states) because the necessary
communication links (all components of the vector $\alpha_{k+1}$ always depends
on all components of the vector $\alpha_k$). The scaling in dimension $N$ of
the pipelined architecture only depends on the memory usage, while the parallel
architecture has a dependency of $N$ for the computation units as well as for
the memory.

\section{Selection of Accelerator Type}
\label{ch:analysis_choice}

In order to choose an appropriate accelerator type, first a list with different
acceleration \gls{hw} is presented. For each type the most common benefits and
shortcomings are listed. At the end of the section a choice will be made using
the following list and the observations discussed in the previous sections.

\begin{description}
    \item[\acrshort{cpu}] \hfill \\
        The \acrfull{cpu} falls into the category of \glspl{gpp} and is
        (usually) of the type \gls{sisd}. It is very flexible in terms of
        \gls{sw} interpretation (with the use of compilers) and allows to
        implement any kind of function in a fast, easy and maintainable fashion
        with no requirements in \gls{hw} knowledge. Operations like division,
        exponential function and logarithm are available as well as the
        floating point number representation. All operations can be executed
        with very high precision and at high clock frequencies (up to 3 GHz).
        \glspl{cpu} come with the drawback of a high power consumption, limited
        parallelization options (small number of cores) and a fixed \gls{hw}
        architecture that causes big computation overheads (instruction
        pipeline, memory hierarchy, generalized computation units).
    \item[\acrshort{gpu}] \hfill \\
        Like the \gls{cpu}, the \acrfull{gpu} still falls into the class of
        \glspl{gpp} due to the \gls{hw} abstraction layers. A \gls{gpu} is
        composed of a lot of small but quite powerful streaming processors of
        the type \gls{simd}. This processing power allows a lot of
        parallelization at a low price. As the \gls{cpu}, also the \gls{gpu} is
        very flexible in terms of \gls{sw} interpretation. However it requires
        some \gls{hw} understanding in order to use the parallel power in an
        optimal way. A \gls{gpu} offers operations like division, exp and log
        functions and provides floating point number representation.
        \glspl{gpu} can work with high precision and at high clock frequencies.
        The power consumption of a \gls{gpu} is very high due to the high
        frequencies and the streaming processors. While the \gls{hw}
        abstraction layer provides flexibility in \gls{sw} and ease of use, it
        is the main reason for a computation overhead for basic operations. The
        fixed \gls{hw} architecture (especially the memory hierarchy) can prove
        to be a drawback in specific cases (e.g. if data usage always provokes
        cache misses).
    \item[\acrshort{dsp}] \hfill \\
        The \acrfull{dsp} is a specialized integrated circuit, largely used for
        digital signal processing. The key components of \glspl{dsp} are
        optimized \gls{macc} instructions, special \gls{simd}
        operations and for \gls{dsp} operation optimized memory architecture.
        They provide a \gls{hw} abstraction and are pretty easy to program.
        This causes some overhead as an instruction pipeline is necessary. The
        overhead is a lot smaller than in the case of \glspl{cpu} because of
        specific instructions sets (this comes with a loss of flexibility).
        Fixed point as well as floating point devices exist with various
        precisions. A \gls{dsp} provides a lot of specific computation power
        for a low price.
    \item[\acrshort{fpga}] \hfill \\
        The \acrfull{fpga} is a customizable integrated circuit. It provides
        large resources of logic gates as well as standard blocks such as RAM
        or highly optimized \gls{macc} units. \glspl{fpga} provide
        high performance for very specific designs, optimized for one function.
        Once an \gls{fpga} is configured, as long as it keeps this
        configuration, no other function will run on this device as it is the
        direct \gls{hw} representation of the function. This direct
        representation allows a very low overhead as operations are done
        directly in \gls{hw} without any instruction pipeline. \glspl{fpga}
        provide a high amount of \gls{hw} flexibility that is only toped by
        \glspl{asic} (see below). This flexibility comes at a medium price as
        \glspl{fpga} can be produced in big lots but are more difficult to
        produce than \glspl{dsp}. A huge advantage is the possibility to
        build very big memory interfaces inside the chip and customize the
        memory architecture for the application at hand. The drawback of
        \glspl{fpga} is the increased development time necessary to implement
        a \gls{hw} solution of a function, the "low" clock frequency of up to
        500MHz (this is low compared to \glspl{cpu} or \glspl{gpu}) and the
        absence of division, exponential and logarithm functions. All units are
        optimized for fixed point representation and floating point numbers
        must be implemented manually. Core generators and very powerful
        synthesis tools try to amend these drawbacks, but still deep
        knowledge of \gls{hw} is necessary to successfully implement a function
        on \gls{fpga}.
    \item[\acrshort{asic}] \hfill \\
        The \acrfull{asic} is, as the name indicates, an integrated circuit
        that has been designed for one (and only one) specific application. In
        comparison to the \gls{fpga}, an \gls{asic} is built with fully
        customized elements and provides the full flexibility achievable with
        todays \gls{hw} knowledge. An \gls{asic} has ideally no overhead as the
        \gls{hw} is a direct mapping of the function. This leads to very high
        performance at very low power consumption (as a rule of thumb a factor
        of 1000 can be assumed in either performance gain or power consumption
        decrease or a combination of both compared to \glspl{cpu}).  An
        \glspl{asic} is very expensive to produce. This includes the long
        development time and the production cost. Deep \gls{hw} knowledge is
        necessary to create an \gls{asic} of a specific function.
\end{description}

Comparing the accelerator types mentioned in the list above in a general
manner, one can conclude that the further down the list one goes, the better
the performance - power consumption ratio and the lower the flexibility of the
device to accept general function descriptions (cf. Figure \ref{fig:hw}, e.g.
a function description for a \gls{fpga} must be a lot more specific than one
for a \gls{gpu}, but the performance-power consumption ratio is a lot better in
case of the \gls{fpga}). For this work, one key point is high performance,
because the algorithm is computationally intensive and needs to be executed
fast. Another important point is the size of the system: the target application
to predict failures is an embedded system where space is usually limited.
Power consumption may not be a main aspect, but it certainly needs to be
considered to not exceed requirements of the main system.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \input{./schema/hw.tex}
    \caption{Approximate representation of flexibility versus performance of
        \acrshort{hw} devices.}
    \label{fig:hw}
\end{figure}

Due to the limited parallelization options or the huge power and space
requirements of \glspl{cpu}, this accelerator type is not suitable for the
application in question. \glspl{gpu} provide a lot of computation power at
a low price but have drawbacks in terms of architecture flexibility, space and
power requirements. \glspl{gpu} are a far better option than \glspl{cpu} but
are not ideal because of the fixed memory interface. \glspl{dsp} would be the
device of choice if only the basic forward algorithm is considered. Due to the
high performance at a low cost of \glspl{dsp}, and the fact that the basic
forward algorithm mainly uses \gls{macc} operations, one or multiple floating
point \gls{dsp} devices could be used to efficiently implement the algorithm.
In case of the extended algorithm a \gls{dsp} device causes too much of an
overhead to compute the \gls{cdf} and will be the bottleneck of the design. For
this reason a more flexible device must be chosen. The most flexible
architecture is an \gls{asic}. \glspl{asic} are very expensive in terms of
money and development time, two resources that were not available for this
thesis. This leaves the \gls{fpga}: An \gls{fpga} combines the parallel power
of \glspl{dsp} for \gls{macc} operations but adds the possibility to design
a specific \gls{hw} architecture to compute the transition probabilities needed
for the extension. While the performance will not be at a level of an
\gls{asic}, the specialized \gls{hw} will still outperform any other device
because of the customizable memory interface (even at the lower frequencies of
\glspl{fpga}).

\section{Prediction Model Simplification}
\label{ch:analysis_simple}

Until now, it was always assumed that the model is fully connected (ergodic),
i.e. that every state can be reached from every other state in the \gls{hsmm}.
This is not necessarily the case, as it is often possible to describe a system
with a simpler model. By adding more constraints to the possible state
transitions (e.g. only one direction, feed-forward), only a few elements in the
transition probability matrix are non-zero. In this case it is beneficial to
use an array (adjacency list) instead of a matrix to represent the transition
probabilities. Different methods have been proposed on how to store sparse
matrices, but they are usually strongly dependent on the architecture and will
hence be discussed in the next chapter where the focus lies on one specific
type of \gls{hw} device. A list with only non-zero elements instead of a sparse
matrix reduces the necessary memory to store the data and makes a lot of
computations superfluous. A Matrix-Vector multiplication parallelization as
described in the previous section would not be beneficial anymore as a lot of
computational units would be idle in most of the time. A sparse matrix vector
multiplication method should be used in this case, but this will not be
analyzed in this thesis.

\chapter{Design and Implementation}
\label{ch:design}
\glsresetall % reset acronyms

Following the argumentation of the previous chapter, this chapter will describe
the design of the pipelined architecture of the extended forward algorithm on
a \gls{fpga}.

To design the accelerator the top-down approach was applied: the algorithm was
broken down into blocks where each of them is broken down further until the
basic functional blocks of the \gls{fpga} can be used for the implementation.
The implementation then follows the bottom-up approach where each sub-block is
implemented and tested. Completed blocks are grouped together to bigger blocks
until finally there is only one big block remaining, describing the complete
algorithm.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%===============================================================================
\section{Architecture}
\label{ch:design_arch}

The top architecture of the proposed algorithm is depicted in Figure
\ref{fig:arch_top}. The non-failure as well as all the failure sequence
detection blocks, denoted as "non-failure" and "failure type S" respectively,
represent each the complete forward algorithm as it was described in the
previous chapter. A system controller, denoted as "SYS CTRL" governs these
blocks and the flash and memory controllers (FLASH CTRL and RAM CTRL,
respectively) load data from persistent respectively from volatile memory
devices into the system. All the prediction blocks calculate a sequence
likelihood and feed it to the classifier denoted as "classification". The
classifier then decides whether the present sequence leads to a failure or not
and returns this result as a boolean value. In terms of \gls{hw}, all the
"failure" blocks are identical and can be run in parallel. They only differ by
the values that are fed into the internal memory of the blocks.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \input{./schema/arch_top.tex}
    \caption{Schematic representation of the top architecture of the failure
        prediction algorithm.}
    \label{fig:arch_top}
\end{figure}

In the following the design details of the failure blocks are presented.
The functionality of the pipelined architecture has already been described in
Chapter \ref{ch:analysis_parallel}. Figure \ref{fig:pipeline} depicts the
basic schematics. The same architecture is shown in Figure \ref{fig:arch_pipe}
with a simplified \gls{rtl} schematic. The main aspect of the chosen design is
to use the high performance \gls{macc} units available in modern \glspl{fpga}.
These so called \gls{dsp} slices allow to perform, besides other functions,
fully pipelined \gls{macc} operations at frequencies of up to 450 MHz. The
manual \cite{xilinx_DSP} describes the vast functional possibilities of the
\gls{dsp} slices available in the series 7 \glspl{fpga} of
Xilinx\footnote{http://www.xilinx.com}. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:arch_pipe},
in each pipeline stage the transition probabilities (coming either from memory
in case of the basic forward algorithm or from a computational unit in case
of the extended algorithm) are multiplied with the forward variables (read out
of the \gls{fifo} queue) calculated in the previous stage and the results are
accumulated. This is done until $N$ components are accumulated, then the
emission probabilities are multiplied to the result and the first component of
the forward variable vector $\alpha_k$ of this stage is stored into a \gls{fifo}
queue of the next pipeline stage. This iteration is repeated $N$ times until
all $N$ component of the $\alpha$ vector are computed. After each iteration,
the accumulator must be cleared. It takes three pipeline stages to pipeline the
\gls{macc}operation and two stages for the multiply operation. It takes $N+3$
cycles to accumulate all multiplication pairs ($\alpha_{k-1, j} * q_{i,j}$) and
$2$ cycles to perform the final multiplication. The setup time of tree and two
cycles only needs to be considered once if a well timed reset of the
accumulator is performed. Therefore the computation of all components pf the
vector $\alpha_k$ adds up to $N^2+5$ cycles.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \input{./schema/arch_pipe.tex}
    \caption{Simplified \acrshort{rtl} representation of the pipelined forward
        algorithm.}
    \label{fig:arch_pipe}
\end{figure}

With this design, there are several things to note. A first concern focuses on
the second multiplier of the chain: It is used only once per $N+3$ cycles
and computes either non-valid data or is idle (if disabled) during the rest of
the time. This is a very poor utilization of resources and can be optimized by
reusing the first multiplier to perform the second multiplication. Doing this
increases the necessary cycles to a minimum of $N*(N+3)+2$ cycles but reduces
the number of required multiplication units (\gls{dsp} slices) by half. Another
point to note concerns the \gls{fifo} queue. The queue is supposed to store the
arriving components of the vector $\alpha_{k-1}$ and use them to compute the
next vector $\alpha_k$. However, each component of the vector $\alpha_{k-1}$ is
used $N$ times, as every component of the new vector $\alpha_k$ depends on
every component of the previous vector $\alpha_{k-1}$. Therefore it is not
possible to use only one \gls{fifo} queue. A solution to this problem is to use
two queues, one to store the arriving new values needed for the next iteration
and one to read the values that have been stored in the last iteration. At the
end of the computation of all components of the vector $\alpha$, the queues are
switched. While a queue is in read state, it operates as a circular buffer by
storing back the value it has just read. Another solution is to use addressable
memory blocks instead of \glspl{fifo} and use a simple counter to increasingly
address the required value to read or to store a new value. While the solution
with the \glspl{fifo} is easier to control, the memory block solution offers
another big advantage: if a simple model for the state transitions is used (as
discussed in Chapter \ref{ch:analysis_simple}), a lot of components of the
transition probability matrix will be zero. It doesn't make sense to compute
the product of zero with a component of the $\alpha$ vector as the result will
always be zero and won't impact the accumulation. Using an addressable memory
block, the $\alpha$ vector components corresponding to a zero in the transition
probability matrix could easily be skipped while with the \glspl{fifo}, this
would not be possible. Choosing an appropriate method to store the sparse
matrix in memory, the computation of the new address to read the next $\alpha$
vector component corresponding to a non zero transition probability can be done
very fast and with only few resources (see Chapter \ref{ch:design_mem} for more
information).

    \caption{\acrshort{rtl} implementation of a pipeline stage with dual memory
        queue and reuse of components.}
    \label{fig:arch_step}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:arch_step} shows the detailed design of one pipeline stage, if
the multiplication unit (\gls{dsp}-slice) is reused and if two memory blocks
are used (alternating one to write new data and one to read data stored from
the last $\alpha$ vector computation). The control signals are not labeled here
for reasons of readability and will be explained in detail in Chapter
\ref{ch:design_ctrl}.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%===============================================================================
\section{Extension}
\label{ch:design_ext}

If the extension is used, for each new event, the transition probability matrix
must be computed. This computation is described by Equation \ref{eq:V} and the
corresponding \gls{cdf} definition. The serial implementation is shown in
Figure \ref{list:ext}. In order to not influence the throughput with the
extension, a top level pipeline of two stages must be introduced. In the first
stage the transition probability matrix is computed and in the second stage the
forward variables. As both stages need to use the same amount of cycles to
complete, the computation of transition probabilities is limited to $N*(N+3)+2$
cycles. This is the amount of cycles available to compute $N^2$ transition
probabilities if the throughput of the system should stay the same. Introducing
this pipeline doubles the latency. Figure \ref{fig:arch_ext} shows the
\gls{rtl} implementation of the transition probabilities. It takes as input the
\gls{cdf} values and the transmission probability values $P$ and performs the
correction of the diagonal of the matrix $V$ (as expressed in Equation
\ref{eq:V}). While the product of the \gls{cdf} and the $P$ values are stored
directly into an internal memory block, the elements are accumulated. After $N$
cycles, the diagonal value corresponding to the row that was just accumulated
($v_{i, sum} = \sum\limits_{\substack{h=1 \\ h \neq i}}^{N} v_{ih}$), is
subtracted and a bitwise inverse is performed to compute $1 - v_{i, sum}$. In
order to not interrupt the pipeline flow when a corrected diagonal value must
be written, a dual-port memory is needed. Note that the values need to be
written column-wise (to use a pipelined accumulator), but to calculate the
$\alpha$ vector, they need to be read row-wise. To prevent interference, two
memory blocks are necessary that act alternating as target for storing values
and as reading memory (similar to the $\alpha$ memory queues described in the
previous section).

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \input{./schema/arch_ext.tex}
    \caption{\acrshort{rtl} implementation of the transition probability
        computation.}
    \label{fig:arch_ext}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:arch_cdf1} shows the design of the exponential \gls{cdf} (cf.
Equation \ref{eq:cdf_exp}), and \ref{fig:arch_cdf2} shows the design of the
Laplace \gls{cdf} (cf. Equation \ref{eq:cdf_laplace}). Due to the very complex
computation of the Gaussian \gls{cdf} (cf. Equation \ref{eq:cdf_gauss}) the
design of this \gls{cdf} was omitted. As described in \cite{ross10}, the
occurrence of failure events can often be described as a Poisson process. This
justifies the choice of omitting the Gaussian \gls{cdf} for this application.
All \glspl{cdf} need the exponential function. In addition, the Laplace
\gls{cdf} needs a division operation, an adder and a comparator. The shift
operation is constant and can be achieved with fixed wiring. The exponential
\gls{cdf} only needs a multiplier and a comparator. Of the required components,
the exponential function poses the biggest problem. Fortunately, implementation
solutions of exponential functions for \glspl{fpga} have been proposed
(\cite{RSSI08_Pottathuparambil, ICFPT05_Detrey}). These solutions are however
designs for floating point numbers. Therefore, the division, multiplication,
comparison and addition operations must also be done in floating points. It is
out of the scope of this thesis to design and/or implement these elements.
There is however the Xilinx CORE Generator
tool\footnote{http://www.xilinx.com/tools/coregen.htm} that can build
a functional blocks performing floating point operations.  Unfortunately there
is no support for exponential functions. Another option of solving this problem
is to use a \gls{lut} storing results of a precomputed exponential function.
The range of the computed values depends on the trained features of the chosen
\gls{cdf}. With an interpolation, intermediate values are calculated. The
benefit of this option is the possibility to go back to a fixed point
representation for all operations. To precompute the complete \gls{cdf} would
be challenging, due to the fact that for each value in $V$ specific \gls{cdf}
parameters are required and hence imply an increased memory complexity to the
order $O(C*N^2)$, with $C$ denoting the number of values necessary to describe
the \gls{cdf}. The extension will not be implemented on a \gls{hw} solution
within the scope of this thesis.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \input{./schema/arch_cdf1.tex}
    \caption{\acrshort{rtl} implementation of the exponential \acrshort{cdf}
        computation.}
    \label{fig:arch_cdf1}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \input{./schema/arch_cdf2.tex}
    \caption{\acrshort{rtl} implementation of the Laplace \acrshort{cdf}
        computation.}
    \label{fig:arch_cdf2}
\end{figure}

The design of both \glspl{cdf} as well as the diagonal correction of the matrix
$V$ is fully pipelined. It takes $N^2+C$ cycles to compute the correct matrix
$V$ where $C$ is the pipeline length. The number of cycles needed for the
forward variable computation are $N*(N+3)+2$. For $C \leq 3N+2$, the throughput
of the system is not affected. As the Xilinx CORE Generator allows to configure
the latency of each block (lower latency means more resources), the design can
be optimized for a specific $N$.

This design proposal of the extension is by far not as optimized as the design
proposed for the forward variable computation. A pure fixed point design
would allow to reduce the resources usage. This would allow to propose
a reasonable design for the Gaussian \gls{cdf} (a \gls{cdf} which is very
often used).

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%===============================================================================
\section{Operand Scaling and Precision}
\label{ch:design_scaling}

The \gls{dsp} slices used to multiply and accumulate operations are designed
for a fixed point data representation, hence they do not support floating point
operations. This poses no problem if an operand width can be chosen that allows
to represent the complete spectrum of all possible values an operand can take
(with respect to a certain precision). The continuous multiplication of
probabilities, as it is the case with the algorithm at hand, leads to very small
values very fast, depending on the sequence length $L$. This is the reason why
a fixed point representation without scaling cannot be used. This can be
avoided by using floating point numbers with a very large exponent to
prevent an underflow. In this case, the \gls{dsp} slices need to be extended in
order to support floating points. In the following this option is discussed and
then compared to a fixed point solution with scaling.

In order to be able to add floating point numbers, which should be done with the
accumulator of the \gls{dsp}-Slice, the exponents of the numbers must be equal.
To achieve that, the difference of the two exponents is calculated and then the
mantissa of the number with the lower exponent must be shifted by this
difference (and possibly rounded/truncated). This process is called
normalization. After the normalization, the mantissas can be added and finally
the resulting value needs to be normalized again. In order to multiply two
floating point numbers, the mantissas of both numbers are multiplied and the
exponents are added (the sign can be ignored, as probabilities are always
positive). For the multiplication of the mantissas the \gls{dsp} slices can be
used. In parallel to this operation, an external adder can add up the
exponents. The result must then be truncated/rounded and normalized.

The work \cite{FPL13_Brosser} presents a solution for floating point
operations, including multiplication and addition, in single
precision\footnote{IEEE 754-2008} using only one \gls{dsp}-Slice. For being
able to omit the scaling completely, the exponent would need to be larger:
assuming that the alphabet contains $M=1000$ elements and using the estimation
of Equation \ref{eq:scaling_estimation}, a sequence length of $L>13$ would
already exceed the capabilities of single precision data representation. The
drawback of this solution is the dependency of the exponent on the sequence
length $L$ and the non-standardized representation. The proposed solution would
have to be extended by a parametrizable exponent size. Another issue In
\cite{FPL13_Brosser} is the absence of a optimized and fully pipelined
\gls{macc} operation.  In order to do multiplication followed by accumulation
with the same \gls{dsp}-Slice, one operation must first finish completely
before the other can begin. This has a huge impact on the latency as well as on
throughput: Using the latencies presented in the work, 22 cycles are necessary
for multiplication and 25 cycles for addition. Using memory to store the
intermediate results the operations could be pipelined, but without additional
memory no pipelining is possible. A more optimized solution for the algorithm
at hand can surely be found, but a more profound analysis of floating point
operations on \gls{fpga} must be performed to gain more insight. This is
however beyond the scope of this work and the present facts are enough to
first consider a fixed point solution with scaling before heading deeper into
floating points.

The documents \cite{smith97, ti04} discuss the choice of fixed point versus
floating point representation with respect to \gls{dsp} devices. This is also
applicable for \glspl{fpga}. On important point is the trade-off between speed
and accuracy. While a fixed-point representation allows to process more data at
a lower precision, a floating-point representation allows a higher precision at
a lower speed. The optimal choice depends on the application.  \cite{ti04}
compares audio with video processing. Audio processing is due to the
sensitivity of the human ear more prone to errors and demands high precision.
In video processing, precision is less an issue. However the amount of image
data to be processed in case of a video is much bigger compared to a audio
stream. By trading speed for more precision, it would make sense to use
a floating-point representation in case of audio processing. On the other hand
by trading precision for more speed, a fixed point representation would make
sense for video processing. In the application at hand, speed is the most
important factor in order to process as much error events as possible (the
speed of the system limits the average occurrence frequency of the
error-events). Considering this, the choice of a fixed point representation is
reasonable. Another factor is the design time. Due to the complexity of
a floating-point data representation, the design time of an application
operating with floating-points on \gls{fpga} is higher than a fixed-point
implementation. Due to the limited amount of time available for this theses,
a fixed-pint implementation is more realistic.

The \gls{dsp} slices allow fixed point \gls{macc} operations with an operand of
bit width 18 and one of bit width 25. Internally the device works with a bit
width of 48 bits. This allows a lossless multiplication (43 bits) and an
accumulation with 5 bits margin for overflow. Due to the properties expressed
in Equations \ref{eq:scaling_sum}, these five additional bits are not necessary
in the present case. After the \gls{macc} operation, the second multiplication
takes again operands of width 18 bits resp 25 bits as input. Therefore, the
result of the \gls{macc} needs to be truncated. In order to not loose too much
information, at this step scaling must be introduced.

As already discussed in Chapter \ref{ch:analysis_scaling} the scaling method
proposed by the reference work should be avoided in this implementation due to
the high requirements in terms of resources. Instead, a scaling in base of
2 can be used (this corresponds to a shift): after the computation of
a component of the initial $\alpha$ vector, a lead zero counter (\gls{lzc})
unit is introduced. This unit is purely combinational and counts the leading
zeros of an operand. The minimal count of all components in the $\alpha$ vector
is then forwarded into the next pipeline stage where it is used to to shift the
result of the \gls{macc} operation for \gls{lzc} positions to the left (this
corresponds to a multiplication with $2^{LZC}$). Also, in this stage (and every
following), a \gls{lzc} unit is added in the same way as described above. The
\gls{lzc} result of each stage is added to the \gls{lzc} result of the next
stage. The minimum \gls{lzc} of all elements of the $\alpha$ vector has to be
found because all operands of one stage need to be scaled by the same value. It
must be the minimum value in order to prevent an overflow in the shifting
operation. It is important to use the same value for all operands to being able
to accumulate the operands without normalization in the next pipeline stage.

Simultaneously to the resulting likelihood, also a scaling factor is provided.
This scaling factor can then be used in the classification step to normalize
all the involved likelihood values and decide if a failure is predicted for the
current event sequence. The scaling method is presented in Figure
\ref{fig:arch_pipe_scale}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \input{./schema/arch_pipe_scale.tex}
    \caption{Simplified \acrshort{rtl} representation of the pipelined forward
        algorithm with scaling using shifters and leading zero counters.}
    \label{fig:arch_pipe_scale}
\end{figure}

To perform the scaling, a \gls{dsp}-Slice can be used by simply multiplying the
operand with the factor $2^{LZC}$. The whole range of internal 43 bits of the
\gls{macc} operation needs to be scaled. The scaling can be achieved by two
cycles of one \gls{dsp}-Slice. First the lower 18 bits ($op_{low}$) of the 43
internal bits ($op$) are introduced into the \gls{dsp}-Slice and multiplied by
the factor $2^{LZC}$. A precomputed \gls{lut} is used to select the factor
corresponding to $2^{LZC}$ using \gls{lzc} as input. In next cycle, the upper
25 bits ($op_{up}$) of $op$ are selected and introduced into the
\gls{dsp}-Slice. $op_{up}$ is shifted by a constant amount of bits
corresponding to the width of the lower part shifted before to the right (this
can be done internally by the \gls{dsp}-Slice) and then also multiplied by the
factor $2^{LZC}$. The accumulator then adds the two shifted operands $op_{low}$
and $op_{up}$ together. This results in a shifted value of $op$ by \gls{lzc}
bits to the right. All these operations can be done by using only one
\gls{dsp}-Slice. Figure \ref{fig:arch_step_scale} shows the necessary
schematics. As described in Section \ref{ch:design_arch}, the simplified
representation of the memory queue has been replaced with two memory blocks.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \input{./schema/arch_step_scale.tex}
    \caption{\acrshort{rtl} implementation of a pipeline stage including
        scaling.}
    \label{fig:arch_step_scale}
\end{figure}

To select the minimal \gls{lzc} value, two registers and a comparator are used.
The first register stores the new \gls{lzc} value and the second register holds
the output \gls{lzc} value. The output register is only updated with the new
value if the new value is smaller than the one already stored in the output
register.

To further increase the precision, the stored values $\pi$, $B$ and $Q$ can be
preprocessed and scaled. Also here, the element with the lowest number of
leading zeros decides the scaling factor. By doing this, the assumption that an
overflow cannot happen due to the fact that probabilities are involved doesn't
hold anymore. Hence, by introducing prescaling, overflow handling and
correction must be added.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%===============================================================================
\section{Memory Architecture and Management}
\label{ch:design_mem}

A huge advantage of \glspl{fpga} is the flexibility in terms of memory
architecture. In \glspl{gpp}, usually a memory hierarchy is used (from fast and
small to slow and big): registers, 1st, 2nd (sometimes 3rd) level cache, then
\gls{ram}, a hard drive and finally the cloud. Usually it is assumed that the
difference in access time between two consecutive levels is one order of
magnitude. Such a hierarchy is very efficient if no knowledge about the data
flow is available (which is usually the case for \glspl{gpp}). Sizes of fast
caches are quite small and are only useful if data is frequently reused. In the
present case however such a memory hierarchy would be bad because of the
high velocity of data. The algorithm at hand always requires the complete
matrix $Q$, which is of size $N^2$, to compute the next forward variable. The
same is true for the vectors $\pi$ and $B(o_j)$. In case of a memory hierarchy
this implies that either the cache is big enough, or there will always be
cache misses. In such cases it is much more beneficial to build a scratch pad
memory architecture: In this type of architecture, the hierarchy is very flat
and one aims to design blocks of memory of appropriate size to store the
necessary data. In \glspl{fpga}, such block ram is internally available. This
has been used to store the values of $\pi$, $Q$ and $B$. In case of the
extension, instead of $Q$ the \gls{cdf} parameters and the values of $P$ are
stored. The $\pi$, $Q$/(\gls{cdf} and $P$) parameter values are stored after
they have been trained and are never changed afterwards.

$B$ changes depending on the occurring event. There are usually to many
different events ($M=1000$) to store all possible $B$ matrices inside the
\gls{fpga}. A two staged pipeline is necessary to keep the throughput at
maximum level. In case of the extension this top level pipeline already
exists. In the first stage of the pipeline, a memory controller reads from an
external memory the $B$ values corresponding to the actual event and stores
them into the internal buffer. This buffer is of the type \gls{fifo}. This
needs to be done for every active prediction model (cf. Figure
\ref{fig:arch_top})

The events do not arrive in a regular interval. They may arrive very fast one
after each other and there may be time intervals where no event arrives. No
hard real time constraints for the prediction system exist: There is no impact
on the prediction quality, if the latency from the time an event arrives, until
the likelihood is computed differs by small amounts. This can be used to even
out the event stream by introducing a \gls{fifo} queue where the events are
stored until the system is able to compute the corresponding likelihood. This
buffer needs to be designed in order to be able to collect events when the
accelerator is used to full capacity and events are arriving faster than the
accelerator can handle. Ideally, the buffer should never be empty and never
full. A buffer that is always empty, indicates that the performance of the
accelerator is too high. The frequency of the accelerator can be lowered in
order to save more energy. If the buffer gets filled up, it becomes
problematic because new events cannot be stored and are lost. If the average
frequency of the arriving events is lower than the maximal throughput of the
accelerator the buffer is designed too small. If the frequency is higher, the
performance of the accelerator is insufficient.

As already mentioned in Chapter \ref{ch:design_arch}, intermediate vectors
$\alpha_k$ need to be stored in memory, as each value is used multiple times to
compute the next vector $\alpha_{k+1}$. \glspl{fpga} provide internal memory
blocks that can be accessed in one clock cycle. These memory blocks limit the
maximal possible values of $N$ and $L$ to be implemented on one \gls{fpga}. $L$
is also limited by the available \gls{macc} units. Table \ref{tab:summary_D}
shows the necessary memory in function of $N$ and $L$.

In Chapter \ref{ch:design_arch}, the option of sparse matrix storage methods
has been discussed. In \cite{FCCM12_Kestur}, several methods on how to store
sparse matrices are compared. In the comparison included are the well known
techniques \gls{csr}, \gls{coo} and \gls{ell}. The proposed method takes
advantage of the fact that \glspl{fpga} can operate on a single bit level. It
is shown that storage methods of the type \gls{bv} can reduce the storage
overhead.

While the reduction of storage overhead is a key aspect of sparse matrix
storage techniques, another aspect must be considered. In order to not
interrupt the pipeline of the proposed design of the accelerator, $\alpha$
vector components corresponding to zero-values in the transition probability
matrix need to be skipped. In order to do that, the address of the $\alpha$
vector memory must be increased to the next corresponding non-zero $Q$ value.
This can only be achieved in a fast way, if the number of consecutive zero
positions is directly obtainable by reading the sparse matrix storage.
Considering this and using the results of the work presented in
\cite{FCCM12_Kestur}, the best option is to use the \gls{cbv} or the \gls{cvbv}
technique. The final choice falls on the \gls{cbv} technique because the
\gls{cvbv} technique increases the complexity of memory controller with the
sole benefit of only small storage overhead reduction. Sparse matrix storage
techniques are not further discussed in this thesis.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%===============================================================================
\section{Controlling the Pipeline}
\label{ch:design_ctrl}

The pipeline of the forward algorithm design is controlled by a global controller
unit. The task of the controller is to balance the pipeline stages. If in a
pipeline stage less operations are necessary than in another the computational
units are only enabled if a computation is necessary. Idle computational units
are disabled in order to minimize dynamic power consumption (prevent the input
signals from switching the transistors inside the unit).

The initial stage as well as the final stage need less computation than the
$L-1$ intermediate stages. The intermediate stages computing $\alpha_k$ are all
equal in terms of \gls{hw}. The controller is realized with a state machine.
Figure \ref{fig:arch_sm} provides a schematic representation. A detailed list
of all the control signals is provided in table \ref{tab:ctrl_detailed}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \input{./schema/arch_sm.tex}
    \caption{Mealy state machine to control the pipeline.}
    \label{fig:arch_sm}
\end{figure}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%===============================================================================
\section{Implementation and Testing}

The implementation of the algorithm was done following the bottom up
approach: Each functional block was tested separately, using test scrips
and the iSimi\footnote{http://www.xilinx.com/tools/isim.htm} simulator of the
Xilinx
ISE\footnote{http://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/ise-design-suite/}
bundle. Figure \ref{fig:test_ctrl} shows an example simulation of the
controller.

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{./schema/test_ctrl.png}
    \caption{Simulation example of the controller.}
    \label{fig:test_ctrl}
\end{figure}

The implementation has been kept as generic as possible with only one
configuration package that allows to set the values $N$, $L$ and $M$ as well as
the operand widths. This generic options have however no impact on the blocks
automatically generated by the Xilinx CORE Generator
tool\footnote{http://www.xilinx.com/tools/coregen.htm}. These need to be
generated again if parameters in the configuration package are changed.

A big issue going from simulation to a real implementation on a physical
\gls{hw} board, are timing constraints. In order to operate at a specific
frequency, the longest critical path is not allowed to be longer than the
period of the clock. Synthesizer options like "register balancing" may help to
reduce the critical path, but often there is no way around adding additional
registers (and increase the pipeline length and hence the latency) or manually
placing critical components in closer proximity to each other. The most
constraining unit is the lead zero counter to perform the scaling. Fortunately
the scaling factor is not required immediately (cf. \ref{fig:arch_pipe_scale})
hence it can be pipelined in order to reduce the critical path. Another critical
unit is the controller. Only one controller provides all control signal for the
pipeline. This results in a big fanout of the control signals (increasing with
$L$) and long path to reach each pipeline stage. The problem of the fanout can
be solved by using clock buffers and the long path can be optimized by manually
placing the controller in the center of the device. Another option would be to
replicate parts of the controller or find relations between control signals and
compute local control signals in the pipeline stages.  Such optimizations for
higher frequencies have not been done due to the complexity and the limited
available time.

The Xilinx CORE Generator has a bug with block \gls{ram} generation in case
of a initialisation of the \gls{ram} with a coe file. Address 0 always returns
undefined. This is only a problem in case of initialisation of the \gls{ram}
with values. In a real application where the \gls{ram} initialised with values
read from a non-volatile memory, this bug has no impact.

The implementation of the basic forward algorithm with a simple scaling scheme
can be found on
github\footnote{https://github.com/moiri/USI-thesis-accelerator}.

\chapter{Results}
\label{ch:results}
\glsresetall % reset acronyms

This chapter presents the results achieved by running sample data on
the accelerator. Due to a lack of real application data, which is very hard
to come by due to confidentiality concerns, test runs have been performed with
pseudo random data respecting the properties of Equation \ref{eq:scaling_sum}.
Random data can be used because \cite{salfner08} performed a thorough
evaluation of the prediction algorithm and showed that accurate predictions can be made. In this
thesis results in terms of speedup, accuracy and usage of resources are
provided. The tests have been performed on the developer board
Nexys4\footnote{http://www.digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?Prod=NEXYS4}
from Digilent. The board is composed of an Artix-7 XC7A100T-1\footnote{http://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/fpga/artix-7/}
\gls{fpga} from Xilinx and peripherals (e.g. \gls{ram}, flash, communication
interfaces). It is a low price product that offers limited amount of
computation units and memory. Tests with values for $N$
and $L$ of up to 100 respectively 50 have been performed on this
device. In order to test the design, the internal memory of the
\gls{fpga} has been loaded with fixed data, and the device was configured to
compute the equivalent to the likelihood of one sequence of event occurrences.

In the following, first the accuracy will be discussed. Then the speedup of the
accelerator compared to a \gls{cpu} is presented and finally the resource
requirements are put in relation with the values of $L$ and $N$.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%===============================================================================
\section{Accuracy}

To test the accuracy of the accelerator, the same data set was used to run the
algorithm on the accelerator and on a test \gls{cpu}. The results from both
devices were used to calculate an error (cf. Equation \ref{eq:error}). The
result of the \gls{cpu} was used as reference value. On the test \gls{cpu} the basic
algorithm was computed (without scaling) for feasible values of $N$ and $L$.
The double precision of the floating points is able to compute a likelihood for
$L \leq 106$, assuming $M=1000$.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:error}
    e = \frac{|result_{cpu}-result_{fpga}|}{result_{cpu}}*100
\end{equation}

Table \ref{tab:res_small} shows the accuracy of the accelerator with operand
widths of 18 bits ($OP_2$) for the emission probability vector $B$ and the
transition probability matrix $Q$ and 25 bits ($OP_1$) for the initial
probability vector $\pi$, the intermediate forward variables $\alpha$, and
the likelihood.

\begin{table}
    \footnotesize
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        $N$ & $L$ & Accelerator & Octave & Error [\%] \\
        \hline
        \hline
        100 & 10 & 1.351E-030 & 1.379E-030 & 1.988 \\
        100 & 20 & 1.746E-060 & 1.816E-060 & 3.834 \\
        100 & 50 & 3.766E-150 & 4.146E-150 & 9.167 \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Accuracy of the accelerator using operand widths of $OP_1 = 25$
        and $OP_2 = 18$ bits.}
    \label{tab:res_small}
\end{table}

The accuracy is very poor. An error of 10\% with values of $N=100$ and $L=50$
is not acceptable and needs to be improved. An improvement of accuracy can be
achieved by using either a larger operand representation, introducing rounding
instead of truncation, or by prescaling operands. As can be seen in in Table
\ref{tab:res_small} the error is increasing very fast with a growing $L$. This
points to a problem with the emission probabilities and excludes a truncation
error. Operand prescaling could help to reduce the error, but no solution with
prescaling has been implemented. This leaves the solution of increasing the
operand width. The source code of the implementation was designed in such a way
to allow changing the operand width with a minimal effort. In order to limit
the increase of resources, only the width of $B$ and $TP$ is increased
from 18 to 25 bits. As $B$ is multiplied to the accumulated result at the end
of each pipeline stage, it is very probable that the small bit width of $B$
causes this big error. The proposed change doubles the number of \gls{dsp}
slices but has no impact on latency and throughput of the accelerator.

Table \ref{tab:res_mid} shows the results with an operand width for all operands
equal to 25 bit. The accuracy is now in an acceptable range for the chosen
values of $N$ and $L$. With $N=100$ and $L=50$ the error is now 0.29\%.
It would be interesting to see the error for bigger values of $L$, but
unfortunately this is not possible because of the available \gls{hw}.

\section{Speedup}

The results of the accelerator were compared to an Intel \gls{cpu} of the type
i7 3537U. This \gls{cpu} operates at a frequency of up to 3.1 GHz. The test
program was implemented with
Octave\footnote{http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/}, using matrix operations
in order to maximize performance of the serial implementation. The test program
was run multiple times in order to allow the \gls{cpu} to use the cache memory
to its full extent.

The accelerator was run at a frequency of 85MHz. Table \ref{tab:res_speed}
lists in the third column the latency of a likelihood, computed on the
accelerator. The next two columns list the delay of consecutive results (the
reciprocal value of the throughput) for the accelerator and the \gls{cpu}. For
values of $L > 106$ scaling is required in case of a computation on the
\gls{cpu}. The results with scaling are listed in column six of Table
\ref{tab:res_speed}. The last two columns show the achieved speedup, comparing
the accelerator to the basic and the scaled serial implementation respectively.
Grey rows represent not real measurements of the computation time of the
accelerator but only estimates. The estimation is based on the results computed
with lower values of $N$ and $L$. These results can be scaled by using the
knowledge that the computation of one $\alpha$ vector component takes $N^2
+ 10N +2 cycles$ to complete. The difference in frequencies of the two devices
was not taken into account (only the real measured computation times are
considered). In general, the table shows that the accelerator is faster than
the serial computation. Using the values for $L$ and $N$ proposed in
\cite{salfner08} the estimated speedup is 48.85.  Considering the difference in
power consumption of the accelerator (estimated consumption of
100mW\footnote{estimated with the ISE design suite of Xilinx}) compared to the
\gls{cpu} (\gls{tpd} of 17W) the results are promising and meet the
expectations.

By analyzing the table in more detail, big jumps in speedup occur whenever $L$
becomes too big and scaling must be applied even with floating point numbers.
Not only scaling is an issue but also the size of data. The bigger $L$ and $N$
grows, the more likely it becomes that the cache of the \gls{cpu} is too small
to hold all values. At this point, memory access is necessary which increases
the computation time considerably.

The throughput of the accelerator depends only on $N$ and is independent of $L$
due to the pipelined architecture. In case of the \gls{cpu} the throughput
decreases with increasing $L$ and $N$.

    \caption{Speedup of the accelerator using operand widths of
        $OP_1 = OP_2 = 25$ bits.}
    \label{tab:res_speed}
\end{table}

To achieve higher speedups the frequency of the accelerator can be increased.
This is possible by optimizing the design in order to reduce the critical
path. With careful placement of components, introduction of registers or clock
buffers, a frequency of up to 250MHz should be possible. To increase the
frequency further the automatically generated blocks need to be replaced and
designed manually.

\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{ch:conc}
\glsresetall % reset acronyms

Throughout this thesis a lot of options have been presented, and a lot of
decisions have been taken. The vast amount of possibilities in the field of
accelerators poses a big challenge to find a solution close to the optimum.
One goal of the thesis was to consider multiple viewpoints and trade-offs and
use interdisciplinary knowledge in order to analyze the problems and then take
the right choice. A lot of decisions are thoroughly discussed and analyzed in
the thesis. However, there is still potential to improve and maybe even
reconsider some points. The former points will be concluded in Section
\ref{ch:conc_ach} and the latter in Section \ref{ch:conc_work}.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%===============================================================================
\section{Main Contribution}
\label{ch:conc_ach}

This thesis proposes a novel design of the basic forward algorithm on
a \gls{fpga}. A fixed point operand representation and a custom operand scaling
scheme is presented. These choices allow to keep the required resources at
a low level and limit the energy consumption. The analysis of reasonable
parallelization options led to to the choice of a pipelined architecture. The
architecture allows to reduce memory access by a factor of $L$. As the design
targets embedded systems, the main focus was to reduce the resource footprint
while keeping throughput and latency at an acceptable level. With small values
of $L$ and $N$ the accelerator performs slightly better than a \gls{gpp}.
A speedup in the order of 10 can be achieved. For small values of $N$ and $L$
the memory hierarchy of \glspl{gpp} poses no problem and is able to handle the
data flow. The better performance of the accelerator is due to the efficient
design and the fixed-point data representation. By increasing $N$ and $L$ the
accelerator performs better and reaches higher speedup factors. This increase
of speedup is caused by limited availability of fast memory in the memory
hierarchy of \gls{gpp}. Another reason for the increased speedup is scaling.
With $L > 106$ (assuming an alphabet size of $M=1000$) scaling becomes
necessary even with double precision representation. For $L=200$ and $N=100$,
values proposed in \cite{salfner08}, a speedup of 48.85 is achieved (this value
has only been estimated).  Due to the lack of a bigger \gls{fpga} test board,
the speedup values for bigger $L$ and $N$ have been estimated by scaling the
results from the real tests. Scaling the results is a valid approach due to the
direct relation of $N$ to the number of required cycles to compute one $\alpha$
vector component.  A limiting factor of scalability is on one hand the
available \gls{fpga} and on the other hand the critical path. By using a bigger
\gls{fpga} it becomes more difficult to run the device at high frequencies.

The thesis further proposes a design solution for a failure prediction model
that is described in \cite{salfner08}. This includes the design of an extension
to the forward algorithm and a memory management system. The extension is
designed by adding a computation unit to calculate a new transition probability
matrix for every occurring error event. The proposed design of the predictor
allows to implement a system capable of predicting one failure type on
a \gls{fpga} board, by using custom peripherals (\gls{ram}, Flash,
communication interface).

On a conceptional point of view, the thesis provides argumentation on why in
a world full of cloud server systems a failure prediction system for a single
node can still be beneficial.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%===============================================================================
\section{Future Work}
\label{ch:conc_work}

The thesis proposes a design and implementation solution for the basic forward
algorithm. However, some work is still necessary for being able to use the
accelerator as a failure predictor. First and foremost, the extension of the
forward algorithm needs to be considered. While a design for the extension of
the algorithm is provided in this thesis, an implementation on \gls{hw} has not
been done. Due to the complexity of the extension the design is provided using
floating point blocks. These blocks are not further described in the thesis.
References on related work or tools to generate corresponding blocks are
provided. To create a consistent design of the extension, a fixed point design
should be performed.

The implementation of the accelerator lacks interfaces to peripherals (e.g.
external volatile and non-volatile memories, communication interface) due to
the non availability of libraries or necessary licences. In order to use the
accelerator in a real case scenario those interfaces must be added. The general
approach would be to load the emission probability matrix of size $N \times M$
from a external non-volatile memory into a external volatile memory (e.g.
\gls{ram}) on power up. The parameters for the \gls{cdf} and the initial state
probabilities can either be loaded from the external non-volatile memory into
the block memory of the \gls{fpga} or the data is already available on the
\gls{fpga}. This can be the case if \gls{rom} storage is used or initialized
block \gls{ram}.  Depending on the occurring event, a corresponding emission
probability vector is loaded into the \gls{fpga} from the volatile memory. The
communication interface needs to be set up in order to read occurring error
events and write prediction results.

By using a simplified model (cf. \ref{ch:analysis_simple}), most of the
transition probability matrix entries would be zero. This allows to use
a sparse matrix storage technique. A design and implementation of such
a technique would reduce the complexity by order $O(N)$. A study of sparse
matrix multiplication parallelization methods could prove to be beneficial in
order to decrease the latency and the throughput of the accelerator. However,
a complete new design would be necessary.

On a more detailed level, some improvements concerning the present
implementation could increase performance, lower resource requirements and
accuracy:
\begin{itemize}
    \item By replacing the $\alpha$ vector \glspl{fifo} with block \glspl{ram},
        the design would allow a simple realization of a sparse matrix storage
        technique. It would also be possible to use only one \gls{ram} block as
        read and write queue for small $N$.
    \item Instead of a simple truncation of the operand, a rounding operation
        would increase the accuracy of the accelerator.
\end{itemize}
